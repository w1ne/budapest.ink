 ### Az Andrássy út pazar villái és palotái

During this event, we will delve into the history of the wealthy patrons and renowned architects who contributed to the neorenaissance architecture of Az Andrássy út.

As we walk from Oktogon towards the City Park (Liget), we will encounter sections of the avenue that gradually transition into a more relaxed and green environment. These parts are adorned with more trees and offer a peaceful contrast to the bustling city life. Our journey will culminate at the Millennium Monument, an iconic landmark in the City Park.

 ### TËRÏDÖ JAM a RAKPARTon — JÚLIUS 30.

TËRÏDÖ JAM a RAKPARTon — JÚLIUS 30.

Join Tëridö for a special outdoor edition in collaboration with Valyo at RAKPART! This event will take place on Sunday, July 30, 2023, from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM UTC+02. The location of the event is 47.497110, 19.047340. 

The Tëridö Jam is an instant composition structure led by Ernő Zoltán Rubik. In the first half of the event, the core team consisting of invited dancers and musicians from TËRÏDÖ and JazzaJ will perform. However, in the second half, anyone from the audience is invited to join in the improvisation. 

Collective free improvisation is a risky art form, as performers cannot deviate from their own stories while being exposed to unexpected situations created by their collaborators. To enhance the creative freedom, the performances are framed within pre-defined boundaries. In an intriguing twist, participants and the duration of each act are drawn from a hat. It will be up to the newly-formed groups to surprise the audience, as well as themselves, with their space-time compositions. 

The event is free to attend, but donations are welcome. The recommended donation amount is 3000 HUF. 

The RAKPART~2023 event series will be taking place between June 17 and September 24, 2023. During these weekends, the section of the pesti alsó rakpart between Lánchíd and Erzsébet híd, specifically on Jane Haining rakpart, will be transformed into a temporary public space, allowing people to engage with the city and the river. The RAKPART~2023 event series aims to bring the community closer to these urban spaces and the river. 

In addition to offering a space for relaxation, dog walking, biking, and socializing, the RAKPART will also host various organized programs, such as yoga classes, acoustic concerts, and social gatherings. The events hosted at VIADUKT will focus on civil and cultural organizations. 

If you would like to organize a program at the RAKPART on future weekends, you can submit your ideas here: [https://bit.ly/rakpart2023](https://bit.ly/rakpart2023). 

The RAKPART~2023 event series is part of the Budapest 150 program, a collaboration between the Municipality of Budapest, Valyo - Város és Folyó Egyesület (City and River Association), and the Budapest Brand. 

Please note that photos and recordings may be taken at the event. By participating, you consent to the use and publication of your appearance and statements during the event, only with your explicit consent.
