Event Announcement: "A vándorló palota" - A Hungarian Anime Movie Screening

Join us on Sunday, July 30, 2023, from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM UTC+02 at Margit körút 5., Budapest for a special screening of the Hungarian dubbed version of "A vándorló palota." This colorful Japanese anime film, directed by Hayao Miyazaki, is a must-watch for anime fans.

The story revolves around Sophie, a hardworking girl who spends her days in her inherited hat shop. Rarely able to have fun in the nearby town due to her young age, Sophie's life takes an unexpected turn when she encounters Howl, a charming wizard. However, their relationship is misunderstood by the jealous Witch of the Wastes, who curses Sophie, transforming her into a 90-year-old woman.

Devastated, Sophie flees to the wastelands until she stumbles upon Howl's moving castle by chance. Keeping her identity a secret, she presents herself as a cleaning lady in the castle. Soon, the mysterious and energetic lady breathes life into the old castle, where only Markl, the wizard's apprentice with a fluffy beard, and Calcifer, the fire demon who operates the house, reside.

This is the place where Sophie can finally unleash her talents and perform extraordinary wonders. Their shared story with Howl is just beginning.

 ### TËRÏDÖ JAM a RAKPARTon — JÚLIUS 30.

TËRÏDÖ JAM a RAKPARTon, also known as the TÉR_IDŐ (SPACE_TIME) jam, will be hosting a special outdoor summer edition in collaboration with VALYO at RAKPART in Budapest. The event will take place on July 30, 2023, from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM local time.

The TËRÏDÖ JAM is an instant composition structure led by Ernő Zoltán Rubik. The first half of the event will feature a special act of dancers and musicians invited by TËRÏDÖ and JazzaJ. In the second half, everyone in the audience will have the opportunity to join in.

Collective free improvisation is a risky but exciting genre. The performers must stay rooted in their own stories while their partners push them into unexpected situations. To enhance the imaginative journey, the event will establish predetermined boundaries within which total freedom can unfold. This seemingly paradoxical state will be achieved by drawing participants and the duration of each act from a hat. The newly-formed groups will then surprise us and themselves with their unique space-time compositions.

The program is free to attend, but donations are appreciated. A suggested donation amount of 3000 HUF is recommended.

The RAKPART~2023 initiative is transforming the lower embankment of the Pest side of Budapest, specifically the stretch between Lánchíd and Erzsébet híd, into a temporary public space every weekend from June 17 to September 24, 2023. This project aims to bring people closer to urban spaces and the river. Alongside the relaxing atmosphere of the riverside, the RAKPART also hosts various organized programs, such as yoga classes, acoustic concerts, and social gatherings. The VIADUKT section of the RAKPART is dedicated to civil and cultural organizations.

If you're interested in organizing a program at RAKPART in the future, you can submit your ideas using this link: https://bit.ly/rakpart2023. RAKPART~2023 is part of the Budapest 150 program series and is made possible through the collaboration of the Budapest Municipal Council, Valyo - City and River Association, and Budapest Brand.

Please note that photos and recordings may be taken at the event. By participating, attendees give consent for their appearance and statements to be recorded and shared, with the understanding that explicit consent will be sought before any personal information is disclosed.

For more information, you can follow Valyo on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/valyovalyo) and Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/valyovalyo).
