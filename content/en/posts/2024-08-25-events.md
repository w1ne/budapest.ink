 ### Dancing Plague ~ Pontoon ~ Sunday Sundown ~ 25th August

## Dancing Plague ~ Pontoon ~ Sunday Sundown ~ 25th August

Join Erasmus Life Budapest for an enchanting evening at Dancing Plague on Sunday, August 25, 2024, starting at 6:00 PM CEST. This event promises to be a celebration of summer filled with uplifting music, set against the picturesque backdrop of Pontoon, the legendary open-air club by the Chain Bridge.

If you're wondering about the name "Dancing Plague," it harkens back to a fascinating historical event in Strasbourg, Alsace, where a dancing mania gripped the city back in 1518 — a bizarre but intriguing piece of history where people couldn't stop dancing for days. While we may not be experiencing dancing mania, we will certainly channel that energy into a night of music, dance, and good vibes.

Featuring a lineup of talented DJs including And/or from Hungary, Arash Ete from Iran, Spicy Mentality from Hungary, and Ratkay also from Hungary, expect to be transported on a musical journey ranging from Trance to Acid House, Power House to Italo Disco, and even Dark Disco to Electro. It's a fusion of sounds that will get your feet tapping and your body grooving.

Come early and stay late as we dance the night away under the stars with free entry for all. Whether you're reuniting with old friends or making new ones, Pontoon provides the perfect setting to chill, soak up the Danube sunsets, and enjoy one of the most breathtaking views the city has to offer.

Don't miss out on this Sunday Sundown event that promises to be a shining moment filled with joy, happiness, and a whole lot of dancing. Mark your calendars for an unforgettable night on August 25th that you won't want to miss!

Ready to let loose and dance your heart out? We'll see you there! 🎶✨
