 ### Dennis Kelly: Árvák

Dennis Kelly's play, Árvák (Orphans), presented by LOUPE Színházi Társulás, explores a gripping crime story that delves into prejudice, incitement of hatred, the division of social classes, the fear and uncertainty that permeate society, and the factors that heavily influence our daily lives. The story revolves around Danny and Helen, who are getting ready for a festive dinner when Helen's brother, Liam, enters the scene covered in blood. 

The play, translated by Horváth János Antal and directed by Horváth János Antal, offers a thought-provoking narrative that examines the complexities of human relationships and societal issues. It raises questions about the resolution of the characters' predicaments, leaving room for the audience to ponder the outcomes. 

The cast includes Lovas Rozi, Lengyel Tamás, and Molnár Áron, who bring the characters to life on stage. The production features striking visual design by Szabó Márton and costumes by Kisprumik Ádám.
