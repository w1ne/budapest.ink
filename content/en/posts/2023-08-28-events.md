 ### A gyűlölet / La haine

A gyűlölet / La haine is a black and white French film that will be screened with Hungarian subtitles. Directed by Mathieu Kassovitz, the film was released in 1995 and has a runtime of 95 minutes. The main cast includes Vincent Cassel, Hubert Koundé, Said Taghmaoui, Abdel Ahmed Ghili, and Solo.

The film tells the story of many people who leave their homeland and start a new life elsewhere. However, most countries do not have a place for them and they end up living in ghettos. In these immigrant-populated suburbs, hatred thrives. Hopelessness, lack of understanding, and isolation permeate into every household, affecting people's souls.

Sixteen-year-old Abdul ends up in the hospital after a clash with the police. His friend Vincent finds a gun that a police officer lost during the riots. Vincent becomes determined that if his friend dies, he will kill a police officer in exchange for his friend's life.

 ### Barta Lajos: Szerelem

Join us for the performance of "Barta Lajos: Szerelem" on Monday, August 28, 2023, at 7:00 PM UTC+02. The event will take place at the Városmajori Szabadtéri Színpad in Budapest.

"Nelli. Lujza. Böske. Egy keserű vénlány. Egy különleges végzet asszonya. Egy széllelbélelt csitri." These are the characters that will captivate you during this performance. The three Szalay sisters, Nelli, Lujza, and Böske, have distinct personalities and desires. They are smart, outspoken, and unafraid to express their opinions. With a touch of humor, they navigate their lives and dare to trust their emotions. 

The girls encounter a variety of Bohemian poets, charming soldiers, and self-preserving bureaucrats who come and go in their lives. Some are virtuosos with words, others masters of anticipation, and some have remarkable self-discipline. Dreams occasionally turn into reality, only to fade away into distant illusions. 

Is this really all that desire, happiness, and love amount to? That is the question explored in this intriguing production. The performance brings together impulses from diverse theatrical worlds and cultural backgrounds. It is a collaboration between Bartók Kamaraszínház from Dunaújváros and Szabadkai Népszínház Magyar Társulata. Actors and creators from Kassa and Marosvásárhely will also take part in this joint production.

Don't miss this opportunity to experience "Barta Lajos: Szerelem" and delve into the fascinating lives of the Szalay sisters. Mark your calendars for Monday, August 28, 2023, at 7:00 PM UTC+02 and join us at the Városmajori Szabadtéri Színpad in Budapest. It's a show that will leave you questioning the nature of desire, happiness, and love. See you there!
