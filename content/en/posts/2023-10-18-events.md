 ### Patrick Süskind: A nagybőgő - Monodráma Klem Viktor előadásában

Event: Patrick Süskind: A nagybőgő - Monodráma Klem Viktor előadásában

Date and Time: None

Location: None

Organizer: De la Motte - Beer-palota

Tickets: [https://bit.ly/PatrickSüskind_A_nagybőgő]

In the monodrama "Patrick Süskind: A nagybőgő," performed by Klem Viktor, the double bass becomes the conduit for a direct conversation between the musician and the audience. The double bass player opens up about his life, his love, his relationship with music and society, his weaknesses, and even plays his instrument during the performance.

Our musician protagonist believes that the double bass is the most important instrument in the orchestra, even though it may not be prominently visible. Through his introspective musings, it becomes clear that he actually hates his double bass and considers it the main source of all his frustrations. The question is whether he can change his life and finally capture the attention of the young soprano singer he secretly admires.

In Patrick Süskind's well-loved one-man play, "A nagybőgő" combines humor and irony to depict a life that has gone off course, portrayed by actor Klem Viktor.

Creators:
- Klem Viktor - Actor
- Ivanyos Ambrus - Script based on the translation by Indali Klára
- Lombos Pál - Double bass "coach"
- Horgas Péter - Set designer
- Szlávik Juli - Costume designer
- Radnai Márk - Director

Prior to the performance, an exclusive guided tour is available for those interested in exploring the painted baroque salons of the De la Motte-Beer-palota. This palace, located in the Budavári Palotanegyed on Dísz tér, bears the name of its former owners. The unassuming exterior of the building houses the grandiose "emphilade" on the first floor, which consists of five baroque rooms arranged in a single axis.

In 1773, the De la Motte family sold the building to Beer József Kajetán, an imperial and royal army pharmacist. It was under his name that the baroque motifs and pictorial representations were added to the rooms. These decorative paintings remained hidden for centuries, covered by layers of paint applied over the years. During World War II, the palace was hit by a bomb, but the final restoration was completed in the spring of 1963. During the mandatory wall investigations prior to replacing the ceiling, researchers discovered the wall paintings in alternating strips. After the removal of approximately 15 layers of paint, the original baroque decorative painting was revealed. The amount and subject matter of the uncovered surface are unparalleled in the civic architecture of Buda Castle.

Before the performance of "A nagybőgő," the audience will have the opportunity to explore the palace's salons adorned with wall paintings and learn about the captivating history of this uniquely fascinating building.

Meeting Point: Dísz tér 15, Budapest 1014
Time: 17:45
Start of the guided tour: 18:00
End of the guided tour: 18:30
