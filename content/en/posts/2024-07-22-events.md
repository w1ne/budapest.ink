 ### Magic Mondays - Discover your true self, make friends, drink tea 

### Magic Mondays - Discover Your True Self, Make Friends, Drink Tea

#### When?
Monday, July 22, 2024, from 6:30‚ÄØpm ‚Äì 9:30‚ÄØpm CEST

#### Where?
the ANT Collective, Tisza utca 11, Budapest, Hungary, 1133

#### What?
Join How To Be A Conscious Human for an evening of exploration at Magic Mondays. This week's theme is "Reality" where you'll delve into the secrets of an ancient spiritual path aimed at unlocking your true potential. Expect meditations, simple rituals, and guidance on expanding your consciousness to new heights. Discover ways to live a happier life, witness the wonders of creation, and enhance your material well-being. The only limit is your imagination.

Ever wonder about the mystical world of magic? Is it a religion, you ask? Magic, also known as Magick, has its roots in ancient Sumeria and has traversed through various civilizations before reaching modern times. But it's not a religion in itself; rather, it's a spiritual path free from beliefs or idols to worship.

Curious about what you'll be doing at the event? You'll learn fundamental spiritual practices to kickstart your journey towards spiritual awareness. From meditations to psychic senses training, you'll gain insight into the history of magic and its relevance in your life, irrespective of your current beliefs.

Can you learn to heal yourself and others through magic? Absolutely. The practices involved can aid in addressing physical, psychological, and spiritual ailments effectively. And don't worry, you don't have to change your belief system entirely. Just keep an open mind and be willing to explore new ideas.

And what about predicting the future? Tools like tarot, i ching, and geomancy can assist in this aspect, but the real question lies in understanding their true meaning and application. No, there won't be any summoning of demons or communicating with spirits during this session. It's a safe environment where everyone is welcome, regardless of their beliefs or level of skepticism.

Meet your host, George Farley, a seasoned ceremonial magician, philosopher, and consciousness explorer, who aims to introduce you to this ancient path towards inner peace and enlightenment. So, mark your calendars, bring some cash (3000 HUF exchange fee, cash-only for now), and don't forget your notebook for an evening filled with spiritual growth and camaraderie at Magic Mondays!
