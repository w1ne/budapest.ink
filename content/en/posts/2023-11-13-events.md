 ### Erzs√©bet Horv√°th: Loess-paleosol sequences ‚Äì the most complete long-term terrestrial archives

The Lithosphere Fluid Research Lab is organizing an event featuring a seminar with Erzs√©bet Horv√°th, a presenter from the Department of Physical Geography at E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University. The seminar, titled "Loess-paleosol sequences ‚Äì the most complete long-term terrestrial archives," will focus on the upper lithosphere and the significance of loess-paleosol sequences as indicators of terrestrial changes.

During the seminar, Horv√°th will explore the importance of analyzing terrestrial sediments or sedimentary formations to understand how different regions responded to temperature variations over the past 2.6 million years of Earth's climatic evolution. Loess-paleosols, which are abundant in certain regions such as China and the Carpathian-Pannonian area, can provide valuable insights into past environmental conditions.

The Loess Research Group at ELTE's Department of Physical Geography is dedicated to generating environmental reconstructions through detailed analyses of prominent loess-paleosol series. By comparing these reconstructions with deep-sea oxygen isotope trajectories, the group has been able to identify subtle climatic changes that correspond to global ice volume fluctuations. This seminar aims to highlight the potential of loess-paleosol sequences as extensive records of terrestrial climate.

The event will take place at P√°zm√°ny P√©ter S√©t√°ny 1C in Budapest. Attendees are invited to join this seminar and learn more about how loess-paleosol sequences can contribute to our understanding of Earth's climatic history. For further information, please refer to the provided link.

 ### Moonsightingüåô

Join us for the Moonsighting event on Monday, November 13, 2023, at 6:50 AM UTC+01. The event will take place at Gell√©rt-hegy, Kelenhegyi √∫t 58., Budapest. This event is organized by Muszlim Ifj√∫s√°gi T√°rsas√°g.

The purpose of this event is to revive the Moonsighting Sunnah in the Islamic calendar. In the Islamic calendar, the sighting of the new crescent moon marks the beginning of a new month. Unlike the Gregorian calendar, where the lengths of months are fixed, Islamic months can vary between 29 and 30 days.

The gathering is planned for Monday, November 13th, which corresponds to the 29th of Rabi II. The aim is to spot the new crescent moon for the month of Jumada II. However, if unfavorable weather conditions like cloud cover or an unclear sky prevent the observation of the moon, the month will be extended to 30 days.

The meeting point for the event is B√∫sul√≥ Juh√°sz Restaurant from 15:30-50. To reach the location, you can take Bus 27 from M√≥ricz Zsigmond Square to the bus stop beside GRoby store. From there, it is a short 5-minute walk to the lookout spot on Gellert Hill.

Please remember to bring your prayer mats (thick picnic mats) as we will be praying Maghrib prayer at the event location. We will also wait for approximately 15-20 minutes for the new crescent to become visible after sunset, as it may not be immediately clear.

Don't miss this opportunity to participate in the Moonsighting event and be part of the revival of an important Sunnah. Use the hashtags #events4muslims and #muslimstudentsbudapest to share your experience with others.
