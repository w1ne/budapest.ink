 ### Magic Mondays - Discover your true self, make friends, drink tea 

## Magic Mondays: Unravel the Secrets of Ancient Spiritual Path

Are you ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and spiritual enlightenment? Join us for Magic Mondays, hosted by How To Be A Conscious Human, where we will delve into the mysteries of an ancient spiritual path that could transform your life in ways you never imagined.

Taking place on Monday, August 26, 2024, from 6:30‚ÄØPM ‚Äì 9:30‚ÄØPM CEST, at the ANT Collective in Budapest, Hungary, this event promises an evening filled with meditations, simple rituals, and guidance on expanding your consciousness. Delve into the realms of magic (or Magick), a spiritual tradition that traces its roots back to ancient Sumeria and has journeyed through various civilizations to reach our modern times.

But what exactly is magic? Is it a religion? While magic draws upon the symbolism of religious practices, it is not a religion itself. It's a path that invites you to explore beyond traditional beliefs and unlock your inner potential. During Magic Mondays, you will learn foundational spiritual practices, delve into the history of magic, and discover whether this unique path resonates with you.

Curious about healing, predicting the future, or communicating with spirits? Magic offers a plethora of tools and practices that can aid in physical, psychological, and spiritual well-being. At Magic Mondays, you'll have the opportunity to explore these aspects under the guidance of George Farley, a seasoned ceremonial magician and consciousness explorer.

Regardless of your beliefs, experience level, or skepticism, Magic Mondays welcome all who seek wisdom and inner peace. The exchange for this transformative experience is 3000 HUF (cash only) at the door. Don't forget to bring a notebook to jot down your insights and revelations.

Embrace the magic within you and join us for an unforgettable evening of spiritual exploration and personal growth at Magic Mondays!
