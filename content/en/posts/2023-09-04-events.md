 ### Török fürdőséta ★ a Király Gyógyfürdőben

Experience Balkan is excited to announce that they will be organizing another successful Török fürdőséta (Turkish Bath Walk) at Hungary's most authentic Ottoman-era bath, the world-famous Király Gyógyfürdő, in October 2023 (exact date to be confirmed). During this guided tour, led by the director of the bath, participants will have the opportunity to explore and learn about the Király Gyógyfürdő, which was built in the mid-16th century and is considered one of the most magnificent medieval baths.

Before the special bath tour, attendees will also get to see what remains of the mosque built by Tojgun Pasha in 1555, learn about the Ottoman bathing culture, explore Buda's most important Turkish baths, and discover the key sights of the Alsó-Víziváros neighborhood. Participants will also have the chance to taste delicious Turkish lokum (Turkish delight) and win Balkan sweet prizes during the walk.

After the bath tour, the group will gather at the iconic Bambi café, which has been in operation since 1565, to discuss the Balkans, the Turks, future programs, or anything else of interest.

Important note: The Király Gyógyfürdő is undergoing extensive archaeological excavation and renovation work, which may start at any time. Therefore, this bath walk may be the last opportunity to experience the Király Gyógyfürdő in its current state. Don't miss out on this unique opportunity to explore the bath like never before.

It is important to note that this bath walk does not include bathing, as the Király Gyógyfürdő is currently closed. However, participants will have the chance to visit its iconic rooms and baths, learn about its history, architecture, hidden spaces, and possibly even its future.

For registration and information about participation, please contact balkan.calling@gmail.com. Please note that spaces are limited.

 ### Ecstatic Dance SHINE! RAGYOGJ! - Hétfői nyitott műhelysorozat

Title: Ecstatic Dance SHINE! RAGYOGJ! - Monday Open Workshop Series

Join Ecstatic Dance Budapest for a unique and transformative dance experience at the Ecstatic Dance SHINE! RAGYOGJ! event, happening every Monday starting from September 4, 2023. This open workshop series focuses on the free expression of self through movement, creating authentic connections, and cultivating joyful experiences within a community setting.

At Ecstatic Dance SHINE! RAGYOGJ!, every movement is an opportunity to express joy and freedom. Participants will engage in playful and experimental activities, uncovering and refining their movement patterns, enhancing their dance experience, and nurturing their creative potential. Whether you have prior dance experience or not, all you need is a desire for exploration and openness.

In this workshop series, you will discover your individual, unrestricted, and creative movement style without the need to imitate teachers or learn predefined steps. Instead, the focus is on teaching you how to listen to the music with your own body and paint rhythm and sounds with your limbs in your unique way. It's your dance, so dive in and enjoy it fearlessly!

The workshop series begins on September 4, 2023, and continues throughout the entire season. You can join any session, and it is recommended to start as early as possible and attend as many workshops as you can. Registration in advance is possible, but you are also welcome to join without prior notice. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the organizers.

What sets Ecstatic Dance SHINE! RAGYOGJ! apart from the Friday and Saturday Ecstatic Dance events is that each workshop introduces and teaches tools to deepen and blossom your personal, natural, free, and spontaneous movement. Additionally, the workshops explore various possibilities of moving together, including partner and group movement options, which participants often enjoy.

If you feel drawn to unstructured, creative, and spontaneous movement but are uncertain about how to engage in it, this workshop series provides guidance, tools, and ample attention to support your easy start. While committing to the entire workshop series is not necessary, it is highly recommended. Commitment not only comes with discounted rates but also allows you to experience the beneficial impact of regular practice. By making the decision to commit, you only have to do it once for yourself. After two to three months of regular practice, you'll feel the noticeable changes that will make you want to continue indefinitely!

The workshop series has a warm and familial atmosphere, as some participants attend regularly, which allows for free-flowing experimentation and creativity.

Come and create shared experiences through these ancient forms of self-expression: music and unrestricted, spontaneous, and free movement. While registration is not required, there is an option to purchase passes for 4 or 8 sessions at a discounted rate. Additionally, if you prepay for your pass, you will receive a 3000 HUF discount and secure your spot.

To sign up, please fill out the registration form: [Link to the registration form]

The class "Lágy és dinamikus" focuses on contemporary dance technique for everyone. The class has a cheerful and friendly atmosphere. It begins with a thorough warm-up of the body, followed by learning important principles of body protection, both in practice and theory. The class incorporates "dancerly" choreographies that directly and indirectly enhance the development of basic coordination skills, while also providing a good workout and relaxation. The class concludes with easy dance movements and stretching to cool down. This class is recommended for non-dancers and amateurs who appreciate simplicity and normality, and enjoy practicing self-esteem and insight.

The class "Élj otthonosan! -A testedben" (Live Cozily! - In Your Body) focuses on body awareness and free dance. The class explores the sensations experienced while moving and the attention given to observing one's own body. Each class offers a different perspective on self-exploration, as the collective work starts from a different viewpoint. The class aims to deepen the understanding and awareness of one's own body through exploring anatomy and biomechanics, as self-knowledge begins with mapping our psychological and somatic functioning. Even observing our posture and gait can provide valuable information, as dynamic posture development has numerous advantages. Improving posture enhances overall body efficiency, reduces mental and physical constraints, and positively affects mood and general attitude towards life. Physical preparation enables us to overcome seemingly insurmountable difficulties with ease. An energized body exudes self-confidence, and improved coordination and observation skills help in dance and everyday life. The class is open to all who are eager to move and interested in exploring simplicity and normality.

Dress comfortably for the classes and bring socks (preferably not synthetic), warm-up pants, as well as long and short-sleeved tops. Avoid wearing nylon tights or large earrings and jewelry. Please refrain from wearing makeup. The class is not accessible with artificial nails.

About the organizer:
Zoltán Grecsó has been teaching contemporary dance since 2003, during his university studies. He is dedicated to understanding the reasons behind the solutions the human body can provide, from the simplest to the most complex movements. Over the years, his teaching approach has evolved, but a calm, accepting, and democratic atmosphere has always been the most important aspect of his classes. Zoltán believes in the value of experimentation and trying, rather than striving for immediate
