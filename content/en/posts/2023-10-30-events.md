 ### Pandeiro Lesson + Roda de Choro (Brazilian jam session) at Szpot

Get ready for a special night of Brazilian music at Szpot! On Monday, October 30th, the Budapest Choro Club is hosting a Pandeiro Lesson followed by a Roda de Choro, which is a Brazilian jam session.

The night kicks off with PANDEIRADA, a group lesson led by Matheus Borges on the Pandeiro, a Brazilian frame drum. The lesson starts at 7:30 PM and is held every Monday at Szpot. The Pandeiro is a vital instrument in Brazilian music, especially in genres like Choro, Samba, and Forr√≥.

But that's not all! After the lesson, you'll have the opportunity to join in a Roda de Choro with Budapest Choro. A Roda de Choro is a gathering of musicians where they play Choro music, a traditional Brazilian genre. Musicians form a circle, taking turns leading, improvising, and harmonizing with instruments like the guitar, violin, flute, and of course, the pandeiro. These gatherings are open to all, creating a sense of community and preserving the cultural heritage of Choro and Brazilian music. It's a social and informal tradition that allows Choro enthusiasts to learn, share, and enjoy the music.

Whether you're a fan of Brazilian music or a musician who plays Choro, Samba, Bossa Nova, or any other type of Brazilian music, this event is for you! Join us for an evening of music, camaraderie, and cultural exploration.
