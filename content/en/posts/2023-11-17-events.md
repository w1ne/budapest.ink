 ### Tibetan Yoga for Health & Well-Being - In-person & Online Course with Alejandro Chaoul 

Tibetan Yoga for Health & Well-Being - In-person & Online Course with Alejandro Chaoul

Are you interested in exploring the ancient practice of Tibetan yoga? Whether you're a beginner or an experienced student, you're invited to join us for a transformative weekend of Tibetan yoga instruction with Alejandro Chaoul. This event will take place on November 17-19, 2023 in Budapest, Hungary, and will be available both in-person and online.

Tibetan yoga, also known as trul khor, is a practice rooted in the B√∂n A-tri Dzogchen tradition. It offers powerful support to all spiritual practitioners, not just those interested in physical yogas. In the Tibetan spiritual traditions, the body, speech/breath, and mind are considered the three doors to enlightenment or the natural state. The contemplative movements of Tibetan yoga allow us to enter all three doors through a single practice, clearing obstacles and obscurations to openness and clarity in meditation.

During this weekend course, Alejandro Chaoul will guide us through the magical movements and postures of Tibetan yoga and teach us how to work with our body and breath to expand our meditation practice and cultivate well-being in our daily lives. We will explore the essential practices of trul khor, its connection to the profound view and practice of Dzogchen, the relationship between the subtle body and meditation, breathing techniques for calmness and peace, and how to keep our meditation practice fresh and inspired.

Alejandro Chaoul is a Senior Teacher of The 3 Doors, an international organization founded by Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche. He has studied in the Tibetan tradition since 1989 and has received teachings from renowned masters. Alejandro is also the author of several books on Tibetan yoga and holds a PhD in Tibetan religions. With over 25 years of teaching experience, he has been sharing these transformative practices with people around the world.
