 ### Miniszobrok budai sétája

Join us for a unique event in Budapest - Miniszobrok budai sétája, which translates to "A Stroll Among Miniature Sculptures in Buda." This event is organized by Korzózz Velünk and will take place on Sunday, October 15, 2023, from 2:30 PM to 5:00 PM UTC+02.

Have you ever wondered how many miniature sculptures can fit into one walk? Perhaps more than forty? Well, this event aims to uncover the mysteries of these tiny hidden treasures scattered throughout Budapest. Join us as we embark on a quest to discover the adventurous secrets of these spatial artworks and explore the unknown side of the city.

During the walk, we will delve into the intriguing stories behind these miniszobrok and try to unlock the secrets of their locations. What is the purpose of a miniature sculpture? Can we decipher the reasoning behind their placement? Which other cities around the world have similar counterparts to the riverside sculptures along the Danube? Who was the first mysterious guerrilla sculptor to place sculptures in secret in Budapest before Kolodko Mihály? And most importantly, can a miniature sculpture convey as much meaning as its larger counterparts?

We will share tales about the smallest and the largest sculptures, extraordinary records of statues and reliefs, and explore the role that these growing numbers of small artworks play among Budapest's statues, memorials, and genre sculptures. After all, it's not about finding a place for the sculpture; it's about finding the sculpture for the place.

For more detailed information about the event, you can visit the official website of Korzózz Velünk at https://www.korzozzvelunk.hu/miniszobrok-budai-setaja/.

 ### Flow 1. szülinapi boulder jam

Join us in celebrating Flow's 1st birthday with a casual boulder jam! Whether you're a beginner climber or an experienced pro, you're invited to join us on October 14th to conquer boulders together and celebrate at our birthday party.

The event will include a jam competition, where participants will write and evaluate their climbs based on the MHSSZ competition rules. The final results will be determined by the number of tops, zones, attempts, and flashes. There will be two categories: pro (female/male) and amateur (female/male). 

For those entering the amateur category, we welcome climbers who have not climbed a 7A/7a difficulty boulder or sport route in the past 2 years. If you haven't climbed outdoors, this difficulty level in the gym means you can complete the green routes but struggle with the red ones. If you have previously placed on the podium in an amateur competition, we kindly ask that you compete in the pro category and give others a chance. 

There will be 30-35 boulder problems on the wall, depending on the category, and you will have 1 hour and 55 minutes to complete them. You can attempt the comp wall in groups of 30, with a 5-minute technical break between groups. The rest of the gym (except for the comp wall) will be open for climbing to those who don't want to compete.

The registration fee is 4000 Ft and includes participation in the competition and a starter pack. You can sign up using the link provided. By registering, you accept the gym's house rules, liability statement, data processing statement, and competition regulations. The registration fee can be paid in cash or by credit card at the reception desk before the competition. Please settle the registration fee by October 10th at the latest. Registrations without payment will be released to those on the waiting list on October 11th.

If the weather permits, we will also be serving grilled food on the terrace. 

The planned schedule for the competition is as follows:
Saturday
08:00 - Gym opens
09:00-10:55 - Group I
11:00-12:55 - Group II
13:00-14:55 - Group III
15:00-16:55 - Group IV
17:00-18:55 - Group V
19:00-20:55 - Group VI
Starting from 21:00, we will have a birthday party with music and lots of climbing. The gym will remain open until everyone is exhausted.

For further inquiries, please contact Bálint Kucsera at +36 20 273 4354.

Please note that rock climbing is considered an extreme sport and is not supported by health insurance. Therefore, the organizers do not provide separate insurance for participants during the competition. By participating, you acknowledge that photos, videos, and recordings will be taken at the event and may be published in various media platforms.

 ### Bödőcs Tibor: Prímszámok hóesésben  // Margó Irodalmi Fesztivál és Könyvvásár 2023

Bödőcs Tibor: Prímszámok hóesésben is an event that is part of the Margó Irodalmi Fesztivál és Könyvvásár, which will take place on Sunday, October 15, 2023, at 6:30 PM UTC+02. The event will feature a conversation between Bödőcs Tibor and Fehér Renátó. Bödőcs Tibor's new book is a collection of small writings, or "miniatures," which come together to paint a mosaic-like picture of the tragicomic world we live in today. From grotesque Buddha fairy tales to apocryphal stories that shed light on the complex and often horrifying history of the 20th century, as well as parodies of cunning philosophers and even the horrors of today's wars, Bödőcs Tibor's writing covers a wide range of topics, including the current Hungarian reality and even imagines the black-humored fate of our planet.

With influences from great writers such as Karinthy, Mrożek, Harmsz, Kafka, Hašek, and Örkény, Bödőcs Tibor's writing style has evolved from the baroque extravagance of "Mulat a manézs" to the creation of concise prose works. His unique wit allows him to parodize various aspects of life without becoming a parody of himself. However, he also shows that even the parody of a parody can be parodied. Bödőcs Tibor was born in Zalaegerszeg in 1982 and is known for his humor. He is now in his forties and not a "sütis" (sweet) or "leveses" (soupy).

The event is organized in collaboration with the Helikon Kiadó and as part of the Liszt Ünnep Nemzetközi Kulturális Fesztivál. The Margó Irodalmi Fesztivál és Könyvvásár is proud to have Bookline as its main supporter, with additional support from MVM and the Nemzeti Kulturális Alap. 

The Margó Irodalmi Fesztivál és Könyvvásár, taking place from October 12-15, 2023, offers a platform for the best contemporary Hungarian and foreign authors, fresh releases, book signings, and evening concerts. The festival also awards the Margó Prize for the best debut prose collection and introduces the Helikon - Margó Könyvek book series. With a variety of programs over the four days, visitors will discover which books are worth exploring in the coming months, because #olvasnikell (#readingisnecessary).

The venue for the event is Millenáris - Nemzeti Táncszínház. While book presentations and signings at the Margó Könyvvásár are free to attend, it is advisable to arrive early to secure a seat, as seating is limited. Tickets are required for the following events: "Kedvencek temetője," "Csillaglekvár," "Slow Village," and "Egyedi-Beck: Fishing On Orfű." Tickets can be purchased on the Liszt Ünnep website.

For book enthusiasts, the Margó Könyvvásár will be open throughout the festival, offering a wide range of books, including those presented at Margó, as well as other favorites, new releases, and discounts. Opportunities for book signings will be available after each book presentation, with specific details provided online and at the venue.

For more information about the Margó Irodalmi Fesztivál és Könyvvásár, you can visit their official website at https://www.margofeszt.hu or their Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/margofeszt.

 ### Lakásmenet after // Giliszta + Hari_drama

Lakásmenet after // Giliszta + Hari_drama

Join us for a night of music and celebration at the Gólya after-party following the Lakásmenet event! The fantastic bands Giliszta and Hari_drama will be performing, so come and let loose with us. It's going to be a great time!

Giliszta is a psychedelic funk and bármicore band from Budapest. Their music is always on-trend and currently indescribable, defying the laws of physics with their irrational songs. After their concerts, you can even ask for their phone number, where anything can happen. Once, for example, a spider spun a web in the corner, and a mosquito flew into it, but due to the dance vibrations and sound waves, they both fell down and got tangled up.

Hari_drama is the newest incarnation of the spacewormz collective by hari_drama. He has only dared to poke his puppet head out of the ground a handful of times during Pesti Éjszaka Vakondtúrásában (Underground Night Mole Excursion), but now he confidently invites you on a cosmic journey through free music. 

The band consists of Stanfel Péter on instruments, Vértesi Ferenc on instruments, Barakonyi Brúnó on instruments, Sikó Alpár on instruments, and the notorious Mushu Israel as a guest for one of his last appearances of the year. And who knows, there might be even more surprises in store.

So mark your calendars and get ready to party! The suggested donation is 2000 Ft. (cash only).

Don't miss out on this amazing event!

 ### BETELT! | KIMONÓ, a japán nemzeti viselet | Előadás és workshop

Join us for an exciting event called "BETELT! | KIMONÓ, a japán nemzeti viselet | Előadás és workshop" at Hopp Ferenc Ázsiai Művészeti Múzeum. This event follows the previous workshop by Dr. Holló Viktória, which was a huge success. Once again, participants will have the opportunity to try on the yukata, a lightweight summer kimono worn by the Japanese. We will also learn fascinating insights about the various meanings and messages conveyed through the depictions of kimonos in our exhibition.

The kimono has evolved over time to become Japan's national attire, influenced by Asian culture. During the Yamato period (250-710 AD), the first kimono-like garments appeared among women. Originally, the term "kimono" referred to any worn clothing, but later it became associated with a specific garment. In general, when laid flat, the kimono forms the shape of the letter "T" and its cutting lines are angular, unlike most Western garments that follow the body's contours. Traditionally, the left side of the garment is folded over the right (the opposite is only done for funerals, as it is considered unlucky for a living person). Kimonos are mainly worn for weddings, funerals, and tea ceremonies. The yukata, a summer version of the kimono, is made of cotton and consists of a single layer. It is still a very popular attire in Japan as it is more comfortable to endure the heat. Many rural hotels and inns provide their guests with yukatas adorned with the hotel's emblem, allowing them to move around within the premises. Additionally, it is also traditional to wear yukatas when watching summer fireworks.

Please note that only a maximum of 20 participants can register for the program. Participation requires both registration and the purchase of a 2500 Ft program ticket valid for the day (the ticket can be purchased in advance or on the day of the program at the ticket office). The program ticket has a standard price and no discounts are applicable, but it also serves as an entry ticket to the exhibition on that day.

To register, please send an email to hopprogram@hoppmuseum.hu. Don't miss out on this unique opportunity to learn about and experience the beauty of Japanese national attire!

 ### Őszi tacskós randevú

Dear Dachshund lovers,

This Sunday, the spotlight will once again be on dachshunds! The summer and the heat are behind us, but it's always great to meet with those who adore our little, stubborn friends and want to have a good time. Can you imagine having lots of running and playing dachshunds in one place? Is there anything better?

Whether you're interested in adopting a dachshund, have questions about the breed, or already have a dachshund and want to buy some new dachshund-related items to support our dachshunds in need of a home - you can do all of that on this day! Even if you don't have a dachshund or can't bring yours, you are more than welcome to join us.

Our host for the event is the team at Vasmacska KávéZoo, a dog-friendly café that always has lots of delicious treats for their guests.

We are counting on your participation! Remember, the café is dog-friendly. This charity event is free for everyone to attend. 

Thank you for sharing the event with others, as this will contribute to the success of the event and help spread the word to as many people as possible!

See you there!

 ### POP UP KIÁLLÍTÁS A WAMPON

POP UP KIÁLLÍTÁS A WAMPON

Are you a fan of contemporary art and design? Then mark your calendar for the Pop Up Kiállítás a WAMPon event, happening at the Néprajzi Múzeum in Budapest on Sunday, October 15, 2023, from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM UTC+02.

Organized by WAMP - the Hungarian design market, this event will feature the works of three young artists: Körei Sándor, Matisz Richárd, and Czagány Ivett. The artists themselves will be present during the design market.

Körei Sándor is known for his contemporary sculptures that reinterpret the still life genre from a painterly perspective. He arranges freshly cut flowers and vases in a structured composition inside tailor-made glass containers. Through this, Körei not only recreates the strict composition of still life painting in a sculptural space but also reflects on the dual nature of flower still lifes - the beauty of vibrant, colorful plants always hinting at the concept of decay. The artist intentionally allows time to play a significant role in his works, as it passes when he seals the sculptures inside the glass boxes.

Matisz Richárd's paintings feature a minimalist and refined visual language where figurative and abstract elements as well as organic motifs merge together. The fragmented shapes resembling natural forms can be interpreted not only as fragments of landscapes but also as autonomous abstract painterly forms that transcend the boundaries of realistic representation. Matisz freely selects his motifs and combines them with various materials, powerful color contrasts, and loose painterly gestures alongside meticulously crafted shapes.

Czagány Ivett, a graduate of the Hungarian University of Fine Arts, focuses on graphic art and painting. Her works utilize a personal system of symbols to convey her inner world. She is interested in different aspects of human existence and the connection between our physical reality and the spiritual realm. Ivett constructs her symbol-like forms using multiple fine lines, allowing for a deeply contemplative creative process. She often combines abstract shapes with organic elements, and her drawings frequently evoke biological phenomena, organs, bones, or cells.

If you are intrigued by the works of these talented artists, don't miss the opportunity to visit the Pop Up Kiállítás a WAMPon event at the Néprajzi Múzeum. It's a chance to appreciate contemporary art and design and engage with the artists themselves. Mark your calendar and join us for a day filled with art and creativity!
