 ### Alternatív gazdaságok a kapitalizmusban

Title: Exploring Alternative Economies within Capitalism

Are there any challengers to the current capitalist economic system? Can any alternatives be realized? And do those who constantly criticize capitalism have any better alternatives to propose? These are the questions that the first open lecture of the fall season aims to explore. The event, titled "Alternatív gazdaságok a kapitalizmusban" (Alternative economies within capitalism), will delve into the possibilities of alternative economic systems and how they can be envisioned, even within the framework of capitalism.

The lecture will shed light on the concept of mixed economies and their potential for providing alternatives to the current capitalist model. It will discuss the functioning and challenges of these economies, as well as the factors that contribute to their success. Additionally, the event will introduce the Solidarity Economic Center (Szolidáris Gazdasági Központ) and the role it plays in the context of alternative economies.

To provide expert insights and practical perspectives, the discussion will feature renowned sociologist Dr. Attila Melegh, an associate professor at Budapest Corvinus University. Joining him will be Zoltán Sidó, a founding member of the Solidarity Economic Center, and Csaba Baroch, a member of the Gólya Cooperative. With their extensive knowledge and practical experience, they will offer valuable perspectives on the topic.

The event will be live-streamed on the TEK website for those unable to attend in person. The location is the Budapest Corvinus University C Building, X Auditorium (ground floor, opposite the entrance).

If you are curious about alternative economic systems within the framework of capitalism and interested in exploring the possibilities, this event will provide valuable insights and perspectives. Join us as we delve into the essence and operational modes of mixed economies, and uncover potential alternatives to the current capitalist model.

 ### Vigyázat, művészet! – Kortárs szabadegyetem: Tayler Patrick

Attention, Art! - Contemporary University: Tayler Patrick
Location: Komor Marcell u. 1., Budapest
Organizer: Ludwig Museum

The Ludwig Museum's Contemporary University lecture series allows the audience to learn about topics related to our temporary exhibitions and the latest art trends in a broader context.

Speaker: Tayler Patrick, painter, art writer

About the Lecture:
The cute aesthetic category conditions us from the moment of our birth. It becomes a point of reference, shedding new light on a series of social power relations as part of culture, and creating surprising perspectives in the common zone of pop culture, nostalgia, and high art. Can infantilism be a conscious image? Why do young art collectors flock to vinyl toys in their homes? What is the dark side of cute?

More About the Speaker:
Tayler Patrick is a painter and art teacher who graduated from the Hungarian University of Fine Arts, where he is currently an assistant lecturer at the Painting Department. From 2018 to 2022, he was a doctoral candidate at the Doctoral School of Art of the University of Pécs. He has been involved in art writing since 2018. He is a contributor and editor at the New Art Journal and a visiting professor at Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design, where he teaches creative writing in English. He participates in various art projects, primarily as a translator and proofreader.

The lecture can be attended with an exhibition ticket!
