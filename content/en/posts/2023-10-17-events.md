 ### Alternatív gazdaságok a kapitalizmusban

Title: Exploring Alternatives to Capitalism

Description: Join us for a thought-provoking discussion on alternative economic systems within the context of capitalism. The event aims to uncover whether there are any challengers to the current capitalist economic structure and whether it is possible to envision and implement alternatives. We will delve into the concept of mixed economies and explore how they can be realized within capitalism. Our panel of experts, including sociologist Dr. Attila Melegh, founding member of the Solidarity Economic Center Zoltán Sidó, and Csaba Baroch from the Gólya Cooperative, will shed light on the workings, challenges, and facilitating factors of these alternative economic systems. Furthermore, they will introduce the Solidarity Economic Center and its role in this field. This event will provide a practical perspective, drawing insights from researchers and practitioners who are actively exploring solutions to these questions. The event will be streamed live on the TEK website.

Date and Time: Not specified
Location: Not specified
Organizer: Társadalomelméleti Kollégium

The criticism of capitalist economic systems is not uncommon in our daily lives. Whether it's through popular culture or office conversations, we often find ourselves critiquing the rich or complaining about our bosses. However, it seems that these criticisms often remain just that - critiques and utopian visions of an unattainable future.

But is there really no alternative to the economic system that we know so well? Can't we envision and implement any alternatives? And what about those who constantly criticize capitalism - do they have anything better to offer?

The goal of our first open lecture this autumn is to explore these questions. We will delve into whether alternative economic systems are achievable, even within the framework of capitalism itself. We will discuss how to envision these alternatives and examine mixed economies that can make them accessible. This conversation will explore possibilities that do not require us to time-travel. We will shed light on how these economies function, the challenges they face, and the factors that support their operations. Lastly, we will uncover what the Solidarity Economic Center (SZGK) is and the role they play in exploring these alternatives.

To guide us through this topic, we have invited esteemed researchers and experts in the field:

- Dr. Attila Melegh, sociologist and associate professor at Budapest Corvinus University
- Zoltán Sidó, founding member of the Solidarity Economic Center (SZGK)
- Csaba Baroch, member of the Gólya Cooperative

These experts, who actively engage in finding solutions to these issues, will bring practical insights to our discussion.

Although the event details regarding date, time, and location are not specified, you can watch the event live on the TEK website as it will be streamed online.

Join us for an engaging conversation as we explore the essence and operational methods of mixed economies and other feasible alternatives to capitalism. Are there truly better alternatives to the current economic system? Let's find out together!

 ### Vigyázat, művészet! – Kortárs szabadegyetem: Tayler Patrick

Attention, Art! - Contemporary University: Tayler Patrick

Join us for the Vigyázat, művészet! – Kortárs szabadegyetem (Beware, Art! - Contemporary University) series at Ludwig Múzeum, where you can explore topics related to our temporary exhibitions and discover the latest artistic trends in a broader context.

Speaker: Tayler Patrick, painter and art writer.

About the Lecture:
The cute aesthetic category conditions us from the moment of our birth. It becomes a point of orientation, shedding new light on a series of social power relations as part of culture, and creating surprising perspectives in the shared zone of popular culture, nostalgia, and high art. Can infantilism be a conscious image? Why are young art collectors drawn to vinyl toys in their homes? What is the dark side of cute?

About the Speaker:
Tayler Patrick is a painter and art educator who graduated from the Hungarian University of Fine Arts, where he currently serves as an assistant professor in the Painting Department. He was a doctoral student at the Doctoral School of Art at the University of Pécs from 2018 to 2022. He has been writing about art since 2018 and is a contributor and editorial staff member of the Új Művészet Képzőművészeti Folyóirat (New Art Visual Arts Journal). He is also a visiting lecturer at Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design, where he teaches creative writing in English. He participates in various art projects, primarily as a translator and editor.

Please note that admission to the lecture requires a valid exhibition ticket. Participation is possible after registration. You can register for the event on the event's website: [link](https://www.ludwigmuseum.hu/.../vigyazat-muveszet-kortars...)

 ### Álmainkban valóra válnak az álmaink

In our dreams, our dreams come true - this is the theme of the group exhibition titled "Álmainkban valóra válnak az álmaink" (Our Dreams Come True in Our Dreams), organized by the Hungarian University of Fine Arts. The exhibition brings together students and instructors from five Hungarian art universities to explore the concept of an ideal art university.

For six months, the participants of the exhibition have been collectively thinking about what an ideal art university would look like. The exhibition responds to the imagined conditions and structure of a utopian art university. The project involved instructors and theoretical experts from five Hungarian art universities - Budapest Metropolitan University, Eszterházy Károly Catholic University, Hungarian University of Fine Arts, Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design, and University of Pécs. The inclusion of instructors with teaching experience was deemed important for the project. Additionally, students currently enrolled in Hungarian higher education institutions specializing in fine arts were also invited to participate through an open call.

The artists participating in the exhibition include Csontó Lajos, Friedrich Barnabás, Illés Anikó, Jóga Eszter, Makay Anikó, Nemes Csaba, Sárvári Regina, Schór Ádám, Solymosi Jakab, Szabó Imola, Szakali Eszter.

The preparation of the exhibition included a series of workshops where students and instructors collectively thought about an imagined ideal art university. Four main themes emerged during these meetings - the human factor, structure/statement, communication/collaboration, and space. The participants continued their work in groups organized around these themes. One key question throughout the process was how to present the emerging thoughts in the form of artwork.

The exhibition "Álmainkban valóra válnak az álmaink" is complemented by a sociological survey sent to students involved in fine arts education. The visualization of this survey will be displayed in the exhibition space, providing insight into the collective work process and the questions discussed along the way.

The curator of the exhibition is Don Tamás, with the assistance of Tóth Boglárka. Workshop leader Dobokay Máté and sociologist Loncsák Noémi also played important roles in the project.

This thought-provoking exhibition offers a glimpse into the dreams and visions of artists and educators about their ideal art university. It raises questions about the current state of art education and invites visitors to contemplate what an ideal art education environment could look like.

Date and Time: Tuesday, October 17, 2023, at 7:00 PM UTC+02

Organizer: Várkert Bazár

On October 17, join us for a special evening dedicated to Szabó Magda, one of the most significant figures in 20th-century Hungarian literature. Szabó Magda is known for her exploration of real life, personal relationships, and human dramas in both poetry and prose, while also delving into universal questions of existence and our place in history. Her popularity stems from her talent, erudition, the accessibility and complexity of her books, and her unwavering honesty. Throughout her career, she always took her readers seriously.

Just a few days after her 106th birthday, we will pay tribute to Szabó Magda and her iconic works through an evening of reflection. We will explore her journey from a young poet to a teacher forced into silence by censorship, from a wife to a renowned prose writer, from a timeless benchmark to a successful yet introspective author. This will be yet another event centered around Szabó Magda, offering a connection point for multiple generations. 

Szabó Magda fearlessly incorporates elements of her own life and family into her writing, depicting the release or inescapability of personal traumas. Join us for this celebratory Szabó Magda evening, where Verebes Linda and Pindroch Csaba, talented actors, will bring her words to life through a dramatic reading. Alongside them, we will be joined by writer guests who will share their personal connections to Szabó Magda's work and discuss the texts that are meaningful to them.

Featured Contributors:
- Szabó T. Anna: poet and writer
- Grecsó Krisztián: writer and poet
- Verebes Linda: actress
- Pindroch Csaba: actor
- Hosted by Juhász Anna: literary scholar
