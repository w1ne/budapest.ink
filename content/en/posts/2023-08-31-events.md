 ### MIKOR JÖSSZ MÉG? JÖVŐ NYÁRON. | Szécsi Noémi önálló fotókiállítása

Event Announcement: MIKOR JÖSSZ MÉG? JÖVŐ NYÁRON. | Szécsi Noémi's Solo Photo Exhibition

Come and experience Szécsi Noémi's captivating solo photo exhibition titled "MIKOR JÖSSZ MÉG? JÖVŐ NYÁRON." This exhibition showcases unique and bizarre photographs that delve into the artist's personal story. It will be held at the Telep Galéria in Budapest, located at Madách Imre út 8.

Szécsi Noémi, who obtained her master's degree in photography from the Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design in 2022, focuses her work on the unusual and the peculiar. Previously, she has captured images of witches ("Nem eshet örökké"), documented funeral directors ("Memento mori"), and explored theater sets ("Ashes to Ashes"). This time, she presents an absolutely personal narrative through her photographs exhibited at the Telep Galéria.

The exhibition revolves around the artist's annual visits to Romania, where she spent her formative years as a child. Two significant individuals, her grandmother Buni and her cousin Timi, play pivotal roles in her life and are the inspiration behind the stories captured in her photos. While the artist's visits have decreased over the years, Buni's old age and Timi's impending parenthood create a growing distance and a bittersweet sentiment for Noémi.

Every summer, Noémi spends a few days at her childhood home, attempting to relive her younger years. Unintentionally, she captures the same images year after year, longing for her own past. However, she realizes that she has almost no photographs of this chapter of her life. In her childhood, when these places and people were her only reality, she could not anticipate that they would become mere memories in the future.

Don't miss the opportunity to delve into the world of Mikor Jössz Még? Jövő Nyáron. This exhibition will offer a glimpse into the artist's personal journey, filled with enchanting and thought-provoking images. Head to the Telep Galéria in Budapest to witness Szécsi Noémi's masterful storytelling through photography.

 ### #olvasniszabad Budapest Nagyregény 2.0 - Szendrői Csaba és Jakobovits Kitti, vendég: Kemény Zsófi

#olvasniszabad Budapest Nagyregény 2.0 - Szendrői Csaba and Jakobovits Kitti, with special guest Kemény Zsófi

Join the #olvasniszabad movement at the Budapest Nagyregény event on Thursday, August 31, 2023, at 6:00 PM UTC+02. This event aims to promote reading, self-development, and the impact of reading on individual personality, consciousness, and thinking. Created by Csaba Szendrői, a poet, award-winning lyricist, singer, and frontman of the Elefánt band, the movement has expanded with the addition of Kitti Jakobovits, psychologist and literature therapist. Together, they provide readers with tools to help them get the most out of reading in their own unique way.

At #olvasniszabad events, participants spend the first hour reading a book of their choice. Afterward, they discuss the most memorable quotes and passages from the day's reading. Following a short break, the second half of the evening is dedicated to a conversation with a special guest. For this summer-closing event, Kemény Zsófi, the youngest author of the Budapest Nagyregény project, will be the guest. Kemény Zsófi is an writer, slam poet, and screenwriter who also performs as Sophie Hard in the spoken word genre.

The event will take place at Filozófusok sétaútja, Budapest. Budapest Nagyregény, a community collaborative project, will publish a book consisting of 23 chapters in November 2023. However, the program extends beyond the book, aiming to collect, tell, and depict stories of the past 150 years of Budapest through district legends and the involvement of its residents. The project uses literature as a means to convey these stories. Prior to the book's release, there will be multi-disciplinary events to promote reading, and in 2024, the chapters of the book and the best stories collected during the research phase will be brought to life through various forms of artistic interpretation.

The Budapest Nagyregény project is implemented by Budapest Brand nZrt. as part of the Könyvfőváros program, with the support of BP 150 and the Creative Europe Fund, in collaboration with Kulturkombinát Kft. and in partnership with the Szabó Ervin Library. The event is jointly organized by #olvasniszabad and Budapest Nagyregény.

For more details, visit bpnagyregeny.hu.

Additional information about the event:

 ### Göndör László – Katona Éva: Nagymamával álmodtam

Title: Göndör László – Katona Éva: Nagymamával álmodtam - An Intimate Conversation

Date and Time: Thursday, August 31, 2023 at 7:30 PM UTC+02

Location: 47.521552, 19.044368

Organizer: Kristály

Are feedback and recognition important in our lives? What happens when we do our best, but it goes unnoticed? These questions form the basis of "Göndör László – Katona Éva: Nagymamával álmodtam," a unique event that invites you to reflect on relationships, intimacy, and self-discovery.

Amidst the quarantine, Göndör László, a well-known personality, decided to move in with his 97-year-old grandmother, Katona Éva. With a significant age disparity of 62 years, he aimed to meet the adored, unattainable figure whom he had long idealized. Through this experience, he hoped to confront the dynamics of their relationship and ultimately come face to face with himself.

What followed was a 32-day journey that transformed their humble apartment into an extraordinary party venue. Exquisite meals, quality champagne, and precious jewelry appeared as if by magic. A mysterious man sang songs from afar, while the Virgin Mary illuminated the shelf next to Lenin. Crows flocked to them, and the first snowfall brought an inexplicable sense of joy. Intriguingly, they both found themselves wearing masks, hinting at the hidden layers of their existence.

The captivating dialogue between Göndör László and his grandmother, Katona Éva, forms the heart of this event. Through their conversations and shared memories, a powerful narrative emerges. The script is written and edited by Bódi Zsófia, Laboda Kornél, and Göndör László, ensuring a compelling and thought-provoking experience for the audience.

"Nagymamával álmodtam" transcends the conventional boundaries of storytelling, offering an intimate and immersive encounter with the complexity of human relationships. Join us on August 31st, 2023, at 7:30 PM UTC+02, as we delve into this extraordinary journey and explore the profound connections that shape our lives.

Please note that the event is organized by Kristály. For more information, visit their official website or contact them directly. Don't miss out on this one-of-a-kind experience that promises to leave a lasting impression on your soul.
