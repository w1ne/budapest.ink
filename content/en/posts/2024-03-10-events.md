 ### K√ÅR - k√∂z√∂ss√©gi sz√≠nh√°zi el≈ëad√°s, tizenk√©t hivat√°s√°t-veszt≈ë emberrel √©s a Mad√°rral

### Event Announcement: K√ÅR - Community Theatre Performance with Twelve Out-of-Work Individuals and the Bird

**Date and Time:** Sunday, March 10, 2024 at 11:00 AM ‚Äì 12:30 PM CET

**Location:** Online

**Organizer:** Jur√°nyi Produkci√≥s K√∂z√∂ss√©gi Inkub√°torh√°z

Are you ready to dive into a unique community theatre experience that explores loss, identity, and resilience? Join the captivating performance of "K√ÅR" on Sunday, March 10, 2024. This powerful production brings together twelve individuals who have lost or are on the brink of losing their professions, which have been integral to their identities. Led by Szab√≥ R√©ka and her team, this theatre piece delves into themes of articulating loss, acknowledging pain, expressing emotions, and confronting challenges.

The narrative unfolds with poignant testimonials of strength, pain, courage, loneliness, struggle, shame, and betrayal. Through text, sound, and movement, the performers aim to initiate a dialogue about the complexities of loss and self-discovery. As part of "The Bird Experience" project, this performance is supported by the Creative Europe Program and involves collaboration with contemporary dance groups from five European countries.

Witness a soul-stirring exploration of loss not just in Hungary but also peek into performances from four other countries simultaneously. The collaboration includes artists and creators such as Andorka T√≠mea, Balpataki Katalin, Barbarics M√°rta, and more, under the direction of Szab√≥ R√©ka. From lighting by Mervel Mikl√≥s to music by Gryllus √Åbris and Ahad aka Zsolt S≈ër√©s, each element contributes to the immersive storytelling experience.

Moreover, the event serves as a platform to address the taboo and often misunderstood topic of grieving professional loss. While public mourning for a deceased person is culturally accepted, grieving the loss of one's vocation can be challenging. This performance not only sheds light on this aspect but also engages with the community through various initiatives led by the Napfogyatkoz√°s Egyes√ºlet.

Join in for a thought-provoking journey through the complexities of loss, courage, and self-discovery. Let the essence of "K√ÅR" resonate with you as you witness a profound exploration of human emotions and resilience.
