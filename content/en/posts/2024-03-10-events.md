### TELTHÁZ Fröccs Almási Kittivel: Elvarratlan szálak - Hogyan békéljünk meg a múlttal?

**Date and Time:** Sunday, March 10, 2024 at 7:00 PM CET

**Location:** Information not available

**Organizer:** Momentán Társulat

Are you ready to let go of past grievances, forgive those who have wronged you, or even forgive yourself for missed opportunities? How do you move beyond the pain and difficulties of the past without getting stuck in them? These are the questions that Almási Kitti tackles in her latest book, "Elvarratlan szálak," where she explores unresolved events and lingering conflicts that affect our emotions, health, relationships, and self-image.

In an evening filled with introspection and reflection, Almási Kitti will guide us through a discussion on how to process these unresolved issues and perhaps find liberation in facing them head-on. The event promises to be a journey towards understanding how to make peace with our past.

Practical details for attendees include dynamic pricing for tickets, with the duration of the performance expected to be around 2.5 hours from 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM, including a break. Seating will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, with the theater doors opening fifteen minutes before the show and the theater bar opening an hour before the performance.

Please note that this event is fully booked. For more of our upcoming programs, visit our website at [Momentán Társulat](https://momentantarsulat.hu/jegyvasarlas). Don't miss this insightful and thought-provoking evening that might just bring you closer to finding peace with your past.
