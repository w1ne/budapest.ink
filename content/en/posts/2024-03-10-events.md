 ### K√ÅR - k√∂z√∂ss√©gi sz√≠nh√°zi el≈ëad√°s, tizenk√©t hivat√°s√°t-veszt≈ë emberrel √©s a Mad√°rral

### Event: K√ÅR - Community Theatre Performance with Twelve Disenchanted Individuals and the Bird
- **Date & Time:** Sunday, March 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM ‚Äì 12:30 PM CET
- **Location:** Unspecified
- **Organizer:** Jur√°nyi Produkci√≥s K√∂z√∂ss√©gi Inkub√°torh√°z

Have you ever pondered on the concept of loss? "K√ÅR," a community theatre production, invites you to delve into the world of twelve individuals who have lost their sense of purpose, alongside a mysterious Bird. The narrative dives deep into the regrets, sorrows, and battles that come with unfulfilled aspirations. Through dialogues, sounds, and movements, the performance unfolds a tale of strength, pain, courage, and betrayal.

Crafted within the framework of The Bird Experience project, supported by the Creative Europe Programme, this production brings together contemporary dance troupes from five European countries. In Hungary, Szab√≥ R√©ka and her collaborators worked with a group of determined adults from various backgrounds who are facing or have faced the loss of their professions, a core part of their identity and driving force of their lives.

The performance aims to initiate conversations about articulating loss, acknowledging our pains, and expressing our emotions. It's a testimony of strength, pain, courage, solitude, struggle, shame, and betrayal. With glimpses into performances from four other countries running parallel, this project offers a unique exploration of loss with diverse artistic interpretations.

Featuring a talented ensemble cast and creators including Andorka T√≠mea, Balpataki Katalin, Barbarics M√°rta, and many more, with direction by Szab√≥ R√©ka and dramaturgy by Sim√°nyi Zsuzsanna, "K√ÅR" promises a thought-provoking and emotionally poignant experience.

If you're intrigued by the themes explored in the performance, the organizers have curated additional activities such as collecting stories of professional loss, writing professional articles, and hosting roundtable discussions. One upcoming event, "D√∂nt√©s vagy k√©nyszer?" on January 25, 2024, from 17:00-18:30 at Jur√°nyi Szk√©n√©, offers a platform for discussing the complexities around career-related loss. Dive into the realm of emotions, losses, and revelations with "K√ÅR."

So, mark your calendars for this immersive journey into the depths of human emotions and experiences.

(*"Unfinished Threads - How to Make Peace with the Past?"*).
