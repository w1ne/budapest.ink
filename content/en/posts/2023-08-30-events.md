In this exhibition, Imre Benkő presents 50 photographs taken in Városliget (City Park), showcasing a slice of Budapest's 150-year history. Starting in 1969, he gradually added to the series over the years. Benkő Imre has a remarkable ability to capture the lives of ordinary people, showcasing their stories with humility and sensitivity. This exhibition also features some rare color photographs, representing a significant contribution to Hungarian contemporary photographic history.

 ### Márton Gyula: Csinibaba

Join us on Wednesday, August 30, 2023, at 7:00 PM UTC+02 for a special event called "Márton Gyula: Csinibaba" at Városmajori Szabadtéri Színpad. This event is a musical comedy based on the original stage adaptation of the film "Csinibaba," directed by Tímár Péter and written by Márton Gyula.

The story is set in 1962 and revolves around the feverish preparations for a talent show. The contestants hope to win and have the chance to go to Helsinki, where they can fulfill their dreams. The play features timeless melodies, including compositions by Fényes Szabolcs, a native of Nagyvárad. It promises to be a community experience and a great family outing.

Novák Eszter, the director of the production, described the show as having its roots in the famous talent show "Ki mit tud?" (Who Can Do What?) of 1962. Just six years after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the opportunity to break free and choose a different life excited the whole country. The fact that the final was televised added to the excitement, as did the possibility of going to Helsinki, which represented the West and the chance to fulfill dreams. The show explores these themes and the desire to escape mundane life.

The cast includes talented actors who bring the characters to life. Simon bácsi will be played by ifj. Kovács Levente, Aranka néni by Molnár Júlia, and Boston Cézárja by Szabó Eduárd, among others. The performance will also feature live music, with Dombi Dávid on keyboards, Abuczki Norbert, Dimény Levente, Kása Tamás on guitar, Kiss Csaba, Szotyori József on drums, Dimény Levente, Tőtős Ádám on bass guitar, and Tőtős Ádám on saxophone.

The creative team behind this production includes Novák Eszter as the director, Kárpáti Péter as the dramaturg, Bóbis László as the choreographer, Fodor Viola as the set designer, and Cristina Breteanu as the costume designer. Suba Sándor and Szamosközi Gergő will serve as the musical directors, with Vajda Bogi as the stage manager and Tentea Katalin as the prompter.

The music for the play was composed by Bágya András, Deák Tamás, Fényes Szabolcs, Hajdú Júlia, Horváth Jenő, Majláth Júlia, Nádas Gábor, and Ullmann Ottó. The lyrics were written by Bacsó Péter, Brand István, Fülöp Kálmán, G.Dénes György, Hajnal István, Hárs László, ifj.Kalmár Tibor, László Endre, Rákosi János, S.Nagy István, and Szász Péter.

Don't miss this exciting performance, which will last approximately 3 hours with one intermission. Join us for a memorable evening of laughter, music, and entertainment at Városmajori Szabadtéri Színpad.

 ### Royal Hunt | Dystopia Tour | Budapest

**Royal Hunt | Dystopia Tour | Budapest**

The Danish progressive hard rock band, Royal Hunt, will be presenting their latest album, "Dystopia Part II," on their summer tour in Budapest. The concert will take place on August 30th at the Analog Music Hall, following a performance by the Hungarian band, Echonald.

The event, called the Dystopia Tour 2023, is organized by Livesound and promises to be an exciting night for fans of Royal Hunt. The band's new album, released last fall, is a continuation and conclusion of their previous release. Titled "Dystopia, Pt. 2," the album was eagerly awaited by their audience, and it was partially funded through community initiatives during its recording.

Royal Hunt, founded by André Andersen in 1989, has sold approximately 1.8 million albums throughout their career. They have toured the world multiple times and continue to create music today, with one of their most successful vocalists, D.C. Cooper, behind the microphone.

The concept of their latest album is based on Ray Bradbury's dystopian science fiction novel, Fahrenheit 451. The recordings feature several guest artists, including Mats Leven (TSO, Skyblood, Vandenberg) and the band's former vocalist, Mark Boals, adding to the dramatic nature of the album. The nearly one-hour-long material unmistakably showcases the symphonic, progressive, and power metal elements that are characteristic of Royal Hunt, with the sound becoming increasingly intense and heavier towards the end. The album is available not only on CD but also in deluxe editions and double vinyl format.

Reflecting on the release of the first part of the Dystopia project in 2020, the band stated, "Looking back at the 2020 release, we realize just how crazy times we've lived in since then. Who would have thought that our Dystopia project would 'reflect' the reality that surrounds us so 'well'? And the craziness is far from over. Anyway, Dystopia Part 2 is more relevant than ever: we followed the original concept but tried to include images that will affect everyone who has lived through the past years."

On August 30th, Royal Hunt will debut their new album in Budapest at the Analog Music Hall. The concert will also feature a performance by the Hungarian modern symphonic metal band, Echonald. Formed in 2006, Echonald has released several major albums, with "Becsület" being their most recent.

Don't miss this opportunity to witness the captivating performance of Royal Hunt and the energetic performance of Echonald. Early bird tickets are available for 8500 Ft, advance tickets for 8900 Ft, and tickets on the day of the concert for 9500 Ft. You can purchase tickets through Tixa (https://tixa.hu/royal-hunt-amh-2023) and Ticketportal (https://www.ticketportal.hu/event/ROYAL-HUNT-support). Save the date and get ready for a night of fantastic music!

Please note that the date and time for the event were not specified in the provided information. Kindly refer to the official ticketing websites for the most up-to-date information regarding the event.
