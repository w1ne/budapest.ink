 ### M√ºller P√©ter: A vihar kapuj√°ban

### M√ºller P√©ter: A vihar kapuj√°ban

**Date and Time:** SUNDAY, APRIL 28, 2024 AT 7:00‚ÄØPM CEST  

**Location:** Unspecified  

**Organizer:** Pincesz√≠nh√°z  

Come unravel the mystery and delve into the intricacies of human nature in "M√ºller P√©ter: A vihar kapuj√°ban" on April 28, 2024, at 7:00 PM CEST. The play, inspired by Ryunosuke Akutagawa's novel, follows the aftermath of a murder that shakes the foundation of trust within a community. 

As a couple flees war-torn Kyoto, they encounter a robber on the yamasinai highway, resulting in a fatal incident where the husband loses his life. However, everyone recounts the events differently, blurring the lines between truth and deception. Can the truth be uncovered when everyone is entangled in lies? Is there anything worse than being a murderer?

Set against the backdrop of a storm, three characters ‚Äì the Priest, the Woodcutter, and the Thief ‚Äì find themselves seeking refuge from the rain. Despite appearing as chance acquaintances, the murder haunts each of them, drawing them together as if they are more than just three coincidental bystanders. With each narrative shared, more details come to light, yet the picture remains increasingly enigmatic.

The play features a talented cast including Kiss Nicolett, Szab√≥ Kimmel Tam√°s, and Widder Krist√≥f, under the direction of √Åd√°m Ny√°ri. With a fusion of music by Okazaki Masato, choreography by Krist√≥f Widder, and set design by T√≠mea Sz√©ll, this production promises to captivate audiences and challenge perceptions.

This performance is recommended for audiences aged 16 and above, offering a thought-provoking exploration of morality, perception, and the complexity of truth. Don't miss the chance to experience "M√ºller P√©ter: A vihar kapuj√°ban" at Pincesz√≠nh√°z in Budapest.
