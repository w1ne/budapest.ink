 ### Talks on everyday imaging ‚Äì the analogue and digital realm of the vernacular

Talks on Everyday Imaging ‚Äì The Analogue and Digital Realm of the Vernacular

Join us for an international talk event in Budapest on November 2, 2023, at the Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design. This event, organized by the Eidolon Centre for Everyday Photography, aims to explore the world of vernacular photography in both its analogue and digital forms.

Vernacular photography, often overlooked in favor of more curated and highbrow forms of photography, is the medium of the millions. It is an immensely flexible and expressive medium that speaks a universal language. However, the current state of photographic production is often described using apocalyptic terms such as an avalanche, an eruption, a tsunami, or a storm. These words convey the impression of an overwhelming and unstoppable flood of newly taken images, disregarding the everyday or vernacular images that have been taken since the inception of photography.

At this event, we seek to delve into the realm of vernacular photography and understand how ordinary people engage with this medium. Vernacular photography is relatable, evokes emotions, and mobilizes people. Through a series of talks by internationally recognized professionals with diverse disciplinary backgrounds, we will explore the latest contemporary, historical, aesthetic, and scholarly thoughts on vernacular photography and its peripheries.

Some of the confirmed speakers for this event include Geoffrey Batchen, Michal Simunek, The Family Museum, Lukas Birk, Judit Gell√©r, Mikl√≥s Tam√°si, S√°ndor Kardos, Annebella Pollen, Joanna Zylinska, and Joachim Schmid. Each speaker will offer unique insights and perspectives on vernacular photography, shedding light on the ongoing discourses surrounding this genre.

Attendance at this event is free, but registration is required to participate. To secure your spot, please register at the following link: [https://rb.gy/unaxa](https://rb.gy/unaxa).

Don't miss this opportunity to engage with the world of vernacular photography and gain new perspectives on this often overlooked aspect of the medium. Join us on November 2, 2023, and be part of the conversation.
