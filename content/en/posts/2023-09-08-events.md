 ### 4 éve az Orczyn! - Minifesztivál a Gólyában

Join us for the "4 éve az Orczyn! - Minifesztivál a Gólyában" event at Gólya in Budapest. This three-day mini festival celebrates the four-year anniversary of Gólya Szövetkezet moving to Orczy út. 

In the past, Gólya had a location in the Bókay utca in the 8th district, but after six amazing and enlightening years, they outgrew the space and had to find a new home. They dreamt big and searched for a property of their own. After a renovation process supported by a tremendous amount of volunteer work, they opened their doors in September 2019 at the Ganz-telep. 

Taking over the space after a year and a half of hard work was incredibly liberating, and it continues to be a great feeling to use the space every day. Initially, only the concert hall was operational, but since then, they have also opened the upstairs guest area and the rooftop terrace for the community's well-being. This new venue has become their home, where they were able to physically bring together different parts of their dreams and mission. They established the Kazán Közösségi Ház bérlői szövetségét (Tenant Alliance of Kazán Community House), allowing them to share the Orczy-n with numerous allied organizations. 

During their time at Gólya Presszó, they have hosted countless concerts, parties, film clubs, performances, and a variety of events. They have also worked hard to maintain a good relationship with their neighbors. This journey has had many milestones, and the story is still continuing. 

Come and join us as we celebrate the countless memories we have made in the past four years. The festival will include a mix of live music performances, including instrumental, electronic, and hip-hop acts that are close to our hearts and have proven themselves multiple times at Gólya. 

The event will take place on September 7, with performances by Verőköltő, Újzenekar, titokzatostelepesek, Bujdosó János, and Főzelékkirály. 

On September 8, Sneaky Times invites Ship Sket from the UK.

And on September 9, Betegszoba presents PestiS Records, Laboratórium Rekordz, and Krekkház.

 ### Sorbonne Sexual Nyárzáró / vendég: lépjünk a holdra ~ Pontoon

Join us at the Sorbonne Sexual summer closing concert, featuring guest band "Lépjünk a Holdra" (Let's Step on the Moon) at Pontoon in Budapest. This will be our only summer concert in Budapest, so let's say goodbye to summer together!

Last year's event was so amazing that we decided to bring Pontoon back and meet again on the Danube. The evening will have two important highlights: our friend Andris Makay will be remixing our first album, "Fáma," which will be released before the concert, and we will also be showcasing some of our upcoming SRBNN songs. It's going to be an exciting night, and we can't wait to see all of you there!

Sorbonne Sexual is known for their creative thinking, their lively stage presence, and their passionate songs. If you haven't heard them before, you can check out their music on YouTube: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIoVSwhBMIw)

"Lépjünk a Holdra" describes themselves as the most graceful creature in the space savannah, the antipop. If you're curious to listen to their music, you can find them on various music platforms: [Link](https://linktr.ee/lepjunk_a_holdra)

Best of all, admission to the concert is free! So mark your calendars and join us for a memorable night of music and celebration as we bid farewell to summer.
