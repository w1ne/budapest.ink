# The Power of Found Images

**Date and Time:** Saturday, April 6, 2024 at 6:00 PM CEST   
**Location:** Online

Are you fascinated by the art of found images and archives? Join us for an enriching discussion featuring two talented artists with unique approaches to exploring the poetic potency of archival imagery.

**Divine Southgate-Smith** is a London-based Togolese-British transdisciplinary artist known for their captivating collage-based works. By combining photographic, musical, and literary references, Southgate-Smith creates a multi-sensory experience that captures fragments of black experiences with profound resonance. Through collage, photography, and mixed media, Southgate-Smith pushes the boundaries between memory and imagination, redefining the potential of archival images beyond their surface representation.

**Szabolcs Barakonyi**, a renowned photographer from Budapest, brings a different perspective to the discussion. With a background in photojournalism and experience exhibiting his work globally, Barakonyi's focus on archives and their contemporary relevance adds depth to the conversation. As the art director of "Fortepan Masters", a notable photo book showcasing the Hungarian private photo archive Fortepan, Barakonyi offers insight into the power of preserving collective memories through visual storytelling.

The discussion, moderated by curator **Krisztián Gábor Török**, will delve into the utilization of archival images in artistic practice, the uncovering of hidden narratives within archives, and the transformative potential of fictional storytelling through imagery.

This event, conducted in English, is free to attend and is organized by the British Council in collaboration with the CEU Open Gallery as part of the Budapest Photo Festival 2024. Don't miss this opportunity to explore the mesmerizing world of found images and archives with two distinguished artists.
