Once upon a time, the Kingdom of Estenel prospered with bountiful treasures and boundless magic. The noble Houses ruled with wisdom and kindness, and House Benosard stood as a symbol of hope for all. However, the winds of change brought whispers of greed and the allure of wealth.

The wise elders of the realm have called upon the noble Houses to prove their worth through a series of challenges. It is up to you and your fellow Mentors to rise to the occasion and bring hope and light back to Estenel.

With unity, wisdom, and courage as your guides, you will embark on an extraordinary journey to determine the destiny of Estenel. The adventure will be filled with challenges, but it also brims with the potential to write a new chapter in the history of the realm. Will you be the hero Estenel desperately needs?

XOXO,
The O.C. of the Mentorcamp
