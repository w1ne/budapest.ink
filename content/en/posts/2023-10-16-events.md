Location: Pet≈ëfi Irodalmi M√∫zeum, K√°rolyi utca 16., Budapest

Are we living up to the legacy of Polcz Alaine, the innovator, the groundbreaker, the brutally honest?

In our everyday lives, in our relationships, and in our public discourse, how do we discuss verbal and physical violence, the female body, pursuing life goals, or preparing for death? Has there been any substantial change since Alaine's passing? What would she think if she were here with us right now?

Our guests, bringing both professional expertise and personal experiences to the table, will delve into Polcz Alaine's boundary-breaking body of work. To aid the discussion, they will draw on Polcz's writings and documentary materials, which can also be viewed at our exhibition titled "Vil√°gj√°t√©k - Polcz Alaine 100."

Join us for this thought-provoking event at the Pet≈ëfi Irodalmi M√∫zeum, located in the stunning K√°rolyi Palace's D√≠szterem. The discussion will take place on October 16, 2023, Monday, at 6:00 PM.

 ### Szemtan√∫k 

**Event Announcement: "Szemtan√∫k" - Trauma Representations from the Collection of the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives**

Join us for the book launch of "Szemtan√∫k" - a collection of trauma representations from the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives. Taking place on Monday, October 16, 2023, from 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM UTC+02, this event is organized by KELET KULT - Irodalmi & Science Caf√©.

The book will be presented by K. Horv√°th Zsolt, a social historian. The discussion will include Farkas Zs√≥fia, an art historian and curator at the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives, as well as Toronyi Zsuzsanna, the director of the museum.

The Holocaust has always been a sensitive and contentious topic when it comes to representation. One approach to this discourse suggests that the only credible means of depicting the events and providing evidence of the experiences are through facts, such as on-site photographs and videos, as well as survivors' diaries and testimonies. Any other form of expression may undermine the sacred inviolability of the inexpressible subject.

The recently released album, "Szemtan√∫k" - Trauma Representations from the Collection of the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives, includes artworks by survivor eyewitness artists. These works capture the experiences of concentration camps, forced labor, and ghetto life, accompanied by biographies and interpretive studies. Within the awareness of the importance of the role of eyewitnesses, these works employ narrative, often captioned, series of drawings to present the events endured during the Holocaust.

The event will raise questions such as whether individual associations, personal visual language, humor, or playfulness, as well as the enjoyment of art, can be reconciled with the horrors of the Holocaust. How can art with such approaches aid in processing trauma? Can visual art convey what words cannot?

This album, which explores the early memory of the Holocaust, seeks to answer questions about what it means to be an eyewitness, whether the event-like representation of personal stories can become therapeutic, and how the combined use of images and text deepens our understanding of memories.

The book was edited and compiled by Farkas Zs√≥fia, with biographies and image catalog by Farkas Zs√≥fia, Marczisovszky Anna, and Toronyi Zsuzsanna.

During and after the discussion, the book will be available for purchase at a discounted price at the venue.

Don't miss this thought-provoking event that sheds light on the representation of trauma and the significance of eyewitnesses!

**Note:** The location of the event is not mentioned in the provided information. Please refer to the event organizers for details on the event venue.

 ### 73. ≈êszi Aukci√≥

Mark your calendars for the 73rd ≈êszi Aukci√≥, organized by Vir√°g Judit Gal√©ria. This highly-anticipated autumn auction will take place on Monday, October 16, 2023, at 6:00 PM UTC+02. 

Prepare to be amazed as this year's auction features some sensational artworks. One of the highlights is an early, large-scale painting by L√°szl√≥ Pa√°l, depicting Beilen in the Netherlands. Also on display is a grandiose scenery by L√°szl√≥ Medny√°nszky, as well as magnificent masterpieces by Lajos Gul√°csy, J√≥zsef Rippl-R√≥nai, and Lajos Tihanyi.

It's a rare and valuable find to come across one of his artworks at auction. The "Composition with Three Circles," which is currently up for bidding, was created in 1946, presumably as part of a kinetic sculptural work designed for constant movement.

 ### JazzaJ / Guionnet (FR) - Murayama (JP) - Gy√°rf√°s

JazzaJ presents an exciting evening of experimental music featuring Jean-Luc Guionnet from Paris on saxophone, Seijiro Murayama from Japan on drums, and Attila Gy√°rf√°s, a talented jazz drummer from Hungary. This unique collaboration began in 2006 when Guionnet and Murayama first met while improvising alongside dancers in a choreography by Catherine Diverr√®s. Inspired by their use of space, intense presence in silence and sound, they decided to further explore these elements in a purely musical project.

At first listen, their music may come across as raw and minimalistic. However, upon closer inspection and with focused attention, the listener is invited to delve into the smallest vibrations and even the concept of "nothingness," revealing a rich and infinitely exciting world. Guionnet's saxophone and Murayama's drums blend harmoniously, creating a captivating sonic landscape.

Joining them on stage is Attila Gy√°rf√°s, a young and experienced jazz drummer who is no stranger to playing with silence and creating minimalist soundscapes. Together, the three artists will each perform solo before embarking on a journey into uncharted soundscapes as a trio.

So mark your calendars for Monday, October 16, 2023, at 7:00 PM UTC+02, and be prepared to experience a night of boundary-pushing and mind-expanding music. Tickets are priced at 3000.- and can be purchased at the entrance. Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity to witness the convergence of three exceptional musicians as they explore the depths of sound and creativity.
