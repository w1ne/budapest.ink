 ### Aranyvonat kiállítás és Szent Jobb-körmenet

Are you fascinated by historical treasures? If so, don't miss the opportunity to admire one of Hungary's most spectacular national treasures, the Aranyvonat (Golden Train) exhibition! 

The Aranyvonat is an impressive train carriage that was created in 1938 to commemorate the 900th anniversary of the death of King Saint Stephen, the founder of the Hungarian state. Unfortunately, during World War II, the railway carriage that transported the Holy Right Hand of Saint Stephen was destroyed. 

In 2015, the Budakeszi Cultural Foundation initiated the reconstruction of the train carriage. After years of careful restoration, the resurrected Aranyvonat was unveiled on August 20, 2020. 

Now, from August 18 to August 20, you have the chance to see this magnificent train up close. The event is organized by Szent István Nap (Saint Stephen's Day) and participation is free. Bring your family and friends and join us in celebrating the importance of Saint Stephen's Day.
