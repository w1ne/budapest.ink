**Time:** 6:30 PM ‚Äì 9:30 PM CEST  
**Location:** the ANT Collective (Tisza utca 11, Budapest, Hungary, 1133)

Have you ever wondered about the mysteries of ancient spiritual paths? Are you curious about unlocking the secrets of your consciousness and living a happier, more harmonious life? If so, then Magic Mondays is the event for you!

Join us for an evening filled with meditations, simple rituals, and guidance on how to develop your awareness beyond what you thought was possible. Led by George Farley, a ceremonial magician and consciousness explorer, Magic Mondays offers a unique opportunity to delve into the world of magic (or Magick) without the need for any specific beliefs or prior experience.

During this session, you'll learn about the history of magic, its practical applications, and whether it resonates as a spiritual path for you. Discover ways to heal yourself and others, explore tools like tarot and i ching for insight, and enhance your psychic senses through various exercises.

You may be wondering, "Is magic a religion?" The answer is no. Magic draws from ancient traditions but is not tied to any specific dogma or idols. It's a path of personal growth and exploration, open to all who approach it with an open mind.

The exchange for this enlightening experience is 3000 HUF (cash only) - a small investment for the potential to transform your perspective and deepen your connection to the spiritual realm. So, grab your notebook, bring your curiosity, and get ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and inner peace at Magic Mondays in Budapest.
