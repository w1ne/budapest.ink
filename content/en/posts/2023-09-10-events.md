In addition to the captivating live acts, there will be giveaways from the artists and the Vibee team. Perhaps you'll be lucky enough to take home some special gifts and souvenirs.

After the live performances, the Vibee DJ team, consisting of Constant and Dtr, will take over the decks and provide the perfect tunes for the occasion, ensuring that the party continues late into the evening.

To add to the overall experience, we have collaborated with Zawar, who has designed unique artwork for the event's cover. You can check out their work on their Facebook page: www.facebook.com/zawar.hu/.
