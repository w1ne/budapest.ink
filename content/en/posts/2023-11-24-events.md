 ### 𝐝𝐮𝐧𝐚𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝟔 ▷▷ Mikolt Tózsa - God, Homeland, Kitchen @Bethlen 

Join us for an intriguing performance titled "Mikolt Tózsa - God, Homeland, Kitchen" at the Bethlen venue as part of the dunaPart festival. This event is scheduled to take place on Friday, November 24, 2023, from 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM UTC+01.

Mikolt Tózsa, a graduate student of Freeszfe's first Theatre and Performance class, has named her exam piece after one of the most frequently used slogans of Christian conservative ideology, "God, Homeland, Family." This slogan has become a political product and is explored in this performance. The play takes inspiration from the opinions of prominent representatives of this ideology and examines the place of women from a critical perspective. 

The performance raises questions about the remnants of a relationship once it is over. What should be done with the material and linguistic remains, as well as the embodied memory? Mikolt Tózsa balances between the material manifestations of national and female identity, engaging the audience in a personal and political, emotional and critical generational overview of the present.

The creator and performer of this piece is Mikolt Tózsa, with lighting design by Antal Szász and sound design by Zoltán Mózes. The staff includes Tímea Oláh and Benjamin Pestalits, and the mentors are Gábor Goda, László Hudi, and Ádám Czirák. Special thanks are extended to Zsófi Rebeka Kozma, Olga Kocsi, Noémi Szántusz, Ádám Tóth, Günther Sarah, Péter Janicsek, Hanna Stern, Dániel Szijártó, Bettina Piller, and Zoltán Imely for their contributions.
