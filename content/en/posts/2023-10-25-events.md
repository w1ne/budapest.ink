 ### Geert Lovink | Extinction Internet

**Geert Lovink | Extinction Internet**

Are you fascinated by the intricacies of the internet and its impact on society? If so, then mark your calendars for an enlightening event on Wednesday, October 25, 2023, at 7:40 AM UTC+02. Renowned media theorist, internet critic, and founder of the Institute of Network Cultures in Amsterdam, Geert Lovink is gracing Budapest with his presence.

Taking place at Zugligeti út 9-25, Budapest, this lecture-performance titled "Extinction Internet" is organized by MOME Media Design and will be held at MOME BASE on the 3rd Floor in room B_306.

But what exactly is "Extinction Internet"? According to Geert Lovink, it is not just some apocalyptic fantasy where digital technology will be wiped out by an electromagnetic pulse or the cutting of cables. Instead, this concept signifies the end of an era of possibilities and speculations, where adaptation is no longer an option.

During what Lovink refers to as the Internet's Lost Decade, he believes that we have been rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, all under the guidance of the consultancy class. So, what can be done to preserve the inevitable? Lovink asserts that we need tools that decolonize, redistribute value, conspire, and organize. It is time for a strike on optimization, and it is within the breakdown that beauty can be found.

With his vast knowledge and unparalleled expertise, Geert Lovink will delve deep into the reality of the internet, its current state, and what lies ahead. Join the platform exodus and be a part of this thought-provoking event that promises to challenge your understanding of the internet and its future.

Don't miss out on this opportunity to gain valuable insights from Geert Lovink. Save the date and be prepared for an intellectually stimulating lecture-performance that will leave you questioning the very foundation of the internet as we know it.
