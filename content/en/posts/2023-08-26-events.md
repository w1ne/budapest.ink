 ### 38. Budapest Mineral Show

The 38th Budapest Mineral Show will be taking place at the Hungarian Railway Museum on August 25th to August 27th. This is the largest mineral fair in the country, where over 200 exhibitors showcase the treasures of the Earth, including minerals, rocks, fossils, and various decorative objects and jewelry made from them. Whether you are looking for inexpensive "pebbles" or valuable gemstones, you will surely find something that catches your eye.

The fair offers not only buying opportunities but also a chance to learn and be entertained. Many of the exhibitors sell specimens they have collected themselves and are more than happy to share the adventurous stories of their findings. Museums with collections of minerals in Hungary also attend the fair and present their newest acquisitions. With the guidance of Dr. Ferenc Hollósy, visitors can learn about the fluorescence of minerals, that is, how they can change color under certain lighting conditions. Those interested in joining mineral collecting trips in Hungary can find information about the requirements and purchase necessary equipment and literature as well.

Among the popular attractions at the fair are games like the Stone Casino wheel of fortune and the gold panning activity. Through these games, visitors can get closer to the fascinating world of nature's third realm, minerals, and rocks. After immersing yourself in the beauty of minerals and other treasures, you can take a ride on the miniature railway in the park, admire historic locomotives and wagons, and enjoy a delicious meal at the cozy railway-themed restaurant with special menus prepared for the event.

Opening hours:
Every day from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM.

We warmly welcome you to the fair! How would you like to explore the largest mineral collection in the country with us? If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.
