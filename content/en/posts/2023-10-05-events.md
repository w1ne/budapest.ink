 ### Megnyitó // Mit tanulhatunk a fáktól? - Csizik Balázs kiállítása

Name: Megnyitó // Mit tanulhatunk a fáktól? - Csizik Balázs kiállítása
Date and Time: October 5, 2023, at 6:00 PM (Thursday)
Location: 47.493090, 19.067540
Organizer: Molnár Ani Galéria

Join us at the Molnár Ani Galéria for the solo exhibition of Balázs Csizik, showcasing his latest works that explore urbanism and the conceptual space of memory. Through examples drawn from his personal life, Csizik poses intriguing questions about our relationship with our surroundings.

Trees have witnessed and experienced more than we can imagine. They are symbols of life and the world in various cultures, carrying universal symbolism. However, they hold more than just this meaning. Whether it's a pine tree in a mountain forest or a piece of beautifully carved wood, the annual rings and carvings preserve personal and local stories.

In his exploration, Csizik focuses on the life of pine trees in three significant places in his life - Székesfehérvár, Budapest, and Csíkszereda. He delves into the essence of these trees, combining ornamental details with wooden objects found in the streets of these three cities. Through this combination, he creates a structure that resonates with both folk and urban folklore.

The exhibition will open on October 5, 2023, at 6:00 PM. Gabriella Uhl, the curator of the exhibition, will inaugurate it. You can visit the exhibition from October 5 to December 2, 2023, during the gallery's opening hours (Tuesday-Friday 12:00 PM-6:00 PM, Saturday 11:00 AM-5:00 PM). Don't miss the opportunity to delve into the fascinating world of Balázs Csizik's artworks and gain new perspectives on trees and our environment.

Note: The coordinates provided (47.493090, 19.067540) are the approximate location of the Molnár Ani Galéria. Please use them as a reference for finding the gallery.

 ### Mansur Brown (UK) | SunMa lemezbemutató

Mansur Brown (UK) | SunMa Album Launch

Join us for a special evening of music as Mansur Brown, a prodigious guitarist hailing from Brixton, London, showcases his debut album, SunMa. Mansur is the epitome of a musical genius, with his compositions effortlessly balancing virtuosic precision and emotive expressiveness. His unique compositional technique blends various musical genres, including nu-jazz, deep funk, instrumental hip-hop, and flamenco-inspired jazz. Mansur's music incorporates elements of flamenco-inspired jazz, funky and airy guitar playing, and innovative production techniques reminiscent of early 2000s R&B, contemporary afrobeats, and the melodic, urban dubstep sounds of Burial.

In Mansur's own words, his music can be both club-like and introspective, but the common thread running through it all is a sense of happiness and gratitude. He aims to create music that rejuvenates and uplifts listeners. This sentiment is perfectly captured in the title of his early single with Alfa Mist, "Love is the Message."

=======================================

SunMa:

Andras Koroknay, a born-and-raised Hungarian musician, is known as one of the country's most innovative music producers. While he is recognized for his bass guitar skills in various bands (such as Àbáse, Manaky, Papaver, and Európa Kiadó), his solo project, SunMa, is currently in the spotlight.

As a nomadic artist, Koroknay divides his time between Budapest, Berlin, and India. His growing discography since 2020 builds a meditative musical world rooted in dub but infused with a myriad of other styles and expressions. He performs his colorful spectrum of music live with a trio lineup, featuring Klausz Ádám on drums and Kálmán András on keyboards. Each performance is tailored to the specific occasion, often featuring plenty of improvisation.

Since his debut concert in 2022 at Badehaus Berlin, SunMa has graced prominent Hungarian venues such as the Magyar Zene Háza, A38, and most recently the Budapest Showcase Hub. Alongside continuous releases like the "Fourth Moment" mixtape and the album recorded at Berlin's Brewery Studios titled "Fountain," SunMa is currently working on a new album, which will be presented to the audience for the first time on this special night.

 ### Népzene és spiritualitás - A MAGYAR NÉPZENE ŐSEREJE - BESZÉLGETÉS ÉS KONCERT!

Join us for an evening of traditional Hungarian folk music and spirituality at the event "Népzene és spiritualitás - A MAGYAR NÉPZENE ŐSEREJE - BESZÉLGETÉS ÉS KONCERT!" The event will take place on Thursday, October 5, 2023, from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM UTC+02 at the location 47.459900, 19.043180.

The event will kick off with a conversation between Grandpierre Attila and Juhász Zoltán, a folk musician, physicist, and researcher of folk music. Juhász Zoltán is the author of the books "A zene ősnyelve" and "A népzene kultúrkörei" (The Primal Language of Music and The Cultural Circles of Folk Music). The topic of discussion will be the ancient past and spirituality of Hungarian folk music.

What do we know about the ancient origins of Hungarian folk music? Juhász Zoltán, a prominent figure in comparative folk music research, introduced mathematical methods to folk music research in the 1970s. In his latest research, he examined the kinship relationships of 59,000 folk songs, extending the analysis to genetics to determine the ancestral sources of populations connected to Hungarian folk music. His findings suggest that 70% of the Bronze Age population in the Carpathian Basin still resides among us, accounting for 20% of the current population. The ancient Hungarian indigenous religion, known as nature worship, attributed sacred value to folk music. The cosmic creative force manifested in the folk spirit is the highest expression of communal and cosmic cohesion. Communal gatherings and festivals provided an opportunity for the intensification of the sense of belonging and the expression of these feelings.

After the conversation, there will be a short break where participants can enjoy refreshments and engage in discussions with like-minded individuals. Following the break, Vágtázó Csodaszarvas, a renowned Hungarian folk music ensemble, will take the stage. They will perform the most ancient layer of Hungarian folk music, showcasing the primal expression power of the genre. The concert will feature Grandpierre Attila on vocals, Bakos Csaba on the Csángó drum, Bese Botond on the Hungarian bagpipe, Fazekas András on drums and percussion instruments, Fábri András on the zither and acoustic guitar, Gebri Bernadett on vocals and koboz, Molnár Krisztina on the violin and morinhoor, Mocskonyi Bramsz Péter on double bass, and Vaskó Zsolt as the wind soloist.

Tickets for the event are available at a price of 2500 Ft in advance or 3000 Ft on the day of the event. Come and immerse yourself in the ancient power and spirituality of Hungarian folk music at this unique event!
