 ### Architectural Matters // Reinier De Graaf

# Architectural Matters // Reinier De Graaf

**Date and Time:** To be announced  
**Location:** To be announced  
**Organizer:** MOME Építészeti Intézet  

Get ready to dive deep into the realm of architecture with a thought-provoking event featuring Reinier De Graaf, a notable Dutch architect and writer. As a partner in the renowned Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) and co-founder of its think-tank AMO, De Graaf brings a wealth of experience to the table. His works include "Four Walls and a Roof: The Complex Nature of a Simple Profession," the novel "The Masterplan," and the recently published "architect, verb."

In a world where architectural projects are often marketed with buzzwords like "world-class," "creative," "sustainable," and "innovative," De Graaf challenges us to ponder the true significance behind these terms. What makes a building worthy of being labeled "world-class"? Why do some cities feel more "livable" than others? How do we define "innovation" in architecture, and what role does it play in enhancing our "wellbeing"?

De Graaf will lead us on a journey to explore how architecture is being influenced by external expectations from fields such as finance, social sciences, and the medical sector. Join Zoltan Neville from the architecture institute as he hosts this insightful "Architectural Matters" event, generously supported by Global Voices at MOME.

For professionals seeking continuing education credits, the Hungarian Chamber of Architects offers the opportunity to earn credits through this event. Registration is mandatory for those interested in obtaining credits: [Register Here](https://forms.gle/BuVrnPPMNs8Gq8Uz8)  

Stay tuned for more details on the date, time, and location of this enlightening event with Reinier De Graaf!

 ### SGM Talk: Psychological Studies on and with Syrians in Türkiye: A Scoping Review

### SGM Talk: Psychological Studies on and with Syrians in Türkiye: A Scoping Review

Are you fascinated by the intersection of psychology and refugee experiences? Join us for an insightful SGM Talk where we delve into the world of psychological studies on and with Syrians in Türkiye. This scoping review, presented by Burcu Akpınar, aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the diverse psychological literature surrounding Syrian refugees in Türkiye from 2011 to 2024.

The Syrian civil war's onset in 2011 triggered a significant displacement of people, leading to millions seeking refuge in neighboring countries, particularly in Türkiye. As a result, Türkiye has become a critical host for a large population of Syrian refugees, sparking increased research within the realm of psychology.

This scoping review seeks to map out the psychological landscape, exploring key themes, methodologies, and findings of studies conducted on Syrians in Türkiye. By examining the breadth and depth of research over the past decade, the review aims to shed light on the multifaceted experiences of this refugee population and identify areas for further investigation.

The event will take place on **7th November 2024 at 3 PM** at the **Institute of Psychology, 1046 Budapest, Izabella Street 46, room 206**. Burcu Akpınar, a social psychology master's student at Bogazici University in Istanbul, will be leading this engaging discussion.

Don't miss this opportunity to gain valuable insights into the psychological studies on Syrians in Türkiye and be part of a thought-provoking conversation in the realm of social psychology. Join us for an evening of discovery and exploration into the complexities of refugee experiences and psychological research.
