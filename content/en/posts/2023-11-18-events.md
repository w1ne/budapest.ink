 ### Legend of Ethereal Budapest: Unveiling Stories from the Underground

Legend of Ethereal Budapest: Unveiling Stories from the Underground

Saturday, November 18, 2023 at 6:00 AM – 10:00 AM UTC+01

Budapest has a rich history of underground movements dating back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These subcultures served as a haven for artists, intellectuals, and rebels seeking to challenge societal norms and embrace alternative lifestyles.

"Legend of Ethereal Budapest" is an art and literary event that pays homage to these historical movements, drawing inspiration from their revolutionary spirit and artistic innovation. Presented by Panel magazine and Szimpla Kert, it revisits the city's bohemian past, celebrating its enduring reputation as a hotbed of artistic innovation.

This event aims to connect participants to the city's past, allowing them to transcend time and space. It embraces the echoes of bygone eras while forging new legends that resonate in the hearts of all who partake in this enchanting artistic journey.

The program for this daytime art festival includes the launch of issue 11 of Panel magazine, featuring readings. There will also be a poetry writing workshop inspired by artworks about Budapest, hosted by Alexa Fermeglia. Participants can join a free art workshop hosted by Olga Lo, a dance performance by Maria Gyarmati, and an AR portal that transports participants to a virtual dimension where they can interact with digital art elements in real-world surroundings, also produced by Maria Gyarmati.

Patrycja Rup will present a sound installation titled "Memories from Invisible Places," which invites participants on a self-guided tour through non-existing places from Budapest's past, only surviving in the memories of citizens and visitors. Additionally, there will be an interactive improv performance produced by Karyn Dietrich.

The producers and contributors of this event are multimedia artists, writers, poets, and cultural managers from various backgrounds who have been living and working in Budapest.

Descriptions of the workshops and performances will be posted soon. So, if you cherish Budapest's uniqueness, its artistic vibe, and if you want to know more about what's beneath the mainstream - what's going on in the underground, independent art scene - come and join us at the Legend of Ethereal Budapest: Unveiling Stories from the Underground.
