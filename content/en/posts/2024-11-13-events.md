 ### Vincenzo Tedesco: Heresy, Magic, and Popular Beliefs in Bernardino of Siena

# Vincenzo Tedesco: Heresy, Magic, and Popular Beliefs in Bernardino of Siena

If you're curious about the intertwining of history, magic, and popular beliefs, then the upcoming seminar by Vincenzo Tedesco is a must-attend event. Hosted by the Institute for Advanced Study at CEU, this session delves into the fascinating world of the 15th century Observant Franciscan friars, focusing particularly on Bernardino of Siena and his influence on the demonization of heretics and witches.

Taking place at an undisclosed location and date, Tedesco's seminar will shed light on how Bernardino's preaching shaped Italian culture, with a specific emphasis on his condemnations of magical practices. These condemnations often culminated in trials by local courts, offering a glimpse into the socio-religious dynamics of the time. The seminar will also explore a unique autograph manuscript, Cod. Lat. 102, housed in the Budapest University Library, which provides invaluable insights into Bernardino's evolving thoughts on heresy, magic, and superstitions.

This event promises a deep dive into the early evolution of religious thought and societal norms, offering attendees a rare opportunity to explore primary sources and engage with a critical period in history. For those intrigued by the intersections of religion, magic, and culture, Vincenzo Tedesco's seminar is an event not to be missed.

To reserve your spot or learn more about the event, kindly RSVP to Agnes Bendik at bendikag@ceu.edu. Stay tuned for further details on the exact date and location, and get ready to journey back in time to uncover the secrets of heresy, magic, and popular beliefs in the context of Bernardino of Siena's legacy.
