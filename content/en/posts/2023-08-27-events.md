 ### 38. Budapest Mineral Show

The 38th Budapest Mineral Show will be held from August 25th to August 27th at the Hungarian Railway Museum (Magyar Vas√∫tt√∂rt√©neti Park) located at Tatai √∫t 95 in Budapest. This is the largest mineral show in the country, featuring over 200 exhibitors showcasing treasures from deep within the Earth, including minerals, rocks, fossils, and decorative objects and jewelry made from them. Whether you're looking for inexpensive pebbles or valuable gemstones, you'll find something to suit your taste at this event.

The mineral show offers more than just an opportunity to buy. It also provides a chance to learn and be entertained. Many exhibitors sell specimens they have collected themselves and are happy to share the adventurous stories behind their discoveries. Museums with local mineral collections also bring and showcase their latest acquisitions. Under the guidance of Dr. Ferenc Holl√≥sy, visitors can learn about the fluorescence of minerals, which is how certain minerals change color under specific lighting conditions. Attendees can also gather information about participating in mineral collecting trips, purchase necessary equipment, and find relevant literature.

The event features popular interactive games, with the "Stone Casino Lucky Wheel" and gold panning being the main attractions. Through these games, visitors can get closer to the third realm of nature, the world of minerals and rocks. In addition to exploring the wonders of minerals and other treasures, attendees can also enjoy a ride on a miniature train in the park, admire old locomotives and wagons, and dine at the charming restaurant that serves special menus for the event.

The mineral show is open from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM every day. Don't miss the opportunity to visit the largest mineral collection in the country. If you have any questions, feel free to contact the organizers. Please note that the organizers reserve the right to modify the schedule and program.
