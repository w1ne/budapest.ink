**Organizer:** Mira Intercultural Community Hungary

Join us for a vibrant and immersive Mexican-themed night on November 3rd, following the joyous celebration of Dia de los Muertos. As we commemorate the spirits of our ancestors, we come together to indulge in the richness of Mexican culture through an interesting documentary and the tasty flavors of authentic Mexican tacos.

The event will start with a screening of the documentary "Beyond the Desert," directed by Ana Zayas and biologist Omar Calva. If you enjoy a mix of adventure and science, this film is for you. It is a documentary dedicated to the cave fauna and highlights the importance of their habitat in the Sonoran Desert, Mexico. The documentary follows Omar as he shares the results of his faunistic studies carried out during his master's degree at the University of Sonora. The documentary, which is 20 minutes long, will be followed by an introduction and discussion with Omar, the director of the film. This will allow viewers to feel part of the discoveries and remind us that conservation is essential with the support of each one of us.

After the screening, we invite you to indulge your taste buds in a delightful array of tacos. The highlight of the evening is the classic beef tacos, but we also offer a scrumptious option for vegetarians - marinated soy tacos. Please note that traditional Mexican cuisine isn't inherently spicy; however, we provide an assortment of sauces on the side, allowing you to customize the spice level according to your preference.

The planned ingredients for the tacos include beef meat, soy, tortillas, onion, coriander, tomato/Mexican green tomato, garlic, avocado, lime, black pepper, chili, cucumber, and radish.

Come one, come all, and let's celebrate the richness of Mexican culture, the wonders of nature, and the joy of community. See you at the screening, and let's taco 'bout the magic of Mexico together!

The event is free of charge, but registration is required as there is limited space available. We can accommodate a maximum of 15 people during this event, so hurry up and register using this link: [Registration Link](https://forms.gle/P9csn2N48eHaRFzc7).
