 ### TÁP Színház: Minden Rossz Varieté

TÁP Színház: Minden Rossz Varieté

Are you ready for a thrilling and dreadful theatrical experience? The TÁP Színház presents "Minden Rossz Varieté", a performance that will make the audience feel absolutely terrible. The theater company begs you not to buy a ticket because it has never been good and it won't be good this time either.

The TÁP Színház started their TÁP VARIETÉ, Színház és Performance series with the title "Minden Rossz Varieté" back in November 2005 at the Süss Fel Nap club in Budapest. The essence of this "Bad Theater," which these performances attempt to achieve, is to go against the current trends and experiment with unconventional theatrical solutions. One of its main goals is to eliminate the anxiety of trying to be "good" and instead focus on liberated, inspired, and improvisational play, which deepens the actors' professional knowledge and enriches their artistic expression. The performers, including actors, dancers, and musicians, always join the production in question, but many of them are regular returnees.

In 2006, "Minden Rossz Varieté" won the main prize for the best performance at the XII. Alternatív Színházi Szemle in Szeged.

The TÁP Színház ensemble is held together by their passionate commitment to bad theater. There are too many good theaters in the world, too many good actors and directors. Too many good plays, too many good performances. Who isn't bored of the excellent lighting, set designs, and costumes? Who hasn't been lulled to sleep by the genius accompanying music? Bad theater is a rare treasure, and it's becoming even rarer. We must value this treasure. We must nurture and TÁP it, preserving it for future generations.

 ### A kávé ünnepe az Edison&Jupiterben / Coffee week at Edison&Jupiter

Coffee lovers, get ready to celebrate your favorite beverage at Edison&Jupiter! From September 25th to October 1st, in honor of International Coffee Day, our baristas will be serving up special treats for an entire week. In addition to our regular specialty offerings, we will also be showcasing exceptional filter coffees with unique roasts from around the world.

To add an extra touch of indulgence to the festivities, Nóri has crafted delicious desserts infused with the unmistakable flavor of coffee. Dessert enthusiasts will delight in our tiramisu, coffee truffles, and coffee cheesecake.

Now, you may be wondering, what exactly is filter coffee? Well, with the filter coffee brewing method, we extract the oils and flavors naturally by allowing water to pass through a filter paper. The result is a wonderfully clean and flavor-rich beverage that resembles tea, showcasing the distinctive flavor notes found in the coffee beans.

Whether you're a seasoned filter coffee connoisseur or someone curious about this brewing technique, we invite you to come and experience the world of filter coffee at Edison&Jupiter. Learn about the different roasts, the brewing process, and immerse yourself in the flavors and aromas of this captivating beverage.
