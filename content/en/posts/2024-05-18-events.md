#### üìç Location:
Small grass field next to "napozoret" in Varosliget, Hungary

Are you looking for a way to give back while having a paw-some time? Join us for the Tax 1% Picnic with Rescue Dogs organized by the Foundation of Animal Protection in F√ºzesabony (FAPF). Grab your blanket, a drink, and a snack, and don't forget to bring your furry friend along. If you don't have a pet, come over to pet and cuddle the adorable rescue dogs.

Let's make the most of the (hopefully) beautiful weather, engage in conversations about animal welfare and rescue efforts, and most importantly, donate your tax 1% to support a noble cause. Wondering what tax 1% is all about? In Hungary, taxpayers have the option to allocate 1% of their taxes to a charity of their choice. This small gesture goes a long way in helping organizations like FAPF rescue and care for sick and injured animals.

Not sure how to donate your tax 1%? No worries! Just drop by the picnic, and one of our friendly volunteers will be there with a laptop to assist you through the process. Your contribution can make a significant impact in the lives of these animals in need.

We can't wait to see you at the small grass field next to "napozoret" in Varosliget for a fun-filled day with adorable rescue dogs. Bring your generosity and love for animals, and let's create a paw-sitive change together!üêæüåü
