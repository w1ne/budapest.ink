 ### Utcáról utcára – Az Epreskert meséi

Event Announcement: "Utcáról utcára – Az Epreskert meséi"

We are excited to announce the upcoming event, "Utcáról utcára – Az Epreskert meséi", which will take place on Wednesday, August 2, 2023, at 6:00 PM UTC+02. The event will be held at Bajza utca 41, Budapest, organized by Eötvös10.

During this event, attendees will have the opportunity to delve into the fascinating story of a unique art colony, set against the backdrop of the overgrown mulberry trees that lend their name to the venue. Together, we will journey back to the late 19th century, a time when Budapest's economic and cultural vibrancy aided in the creation of this artistic community on the outskirts of the city, consisting of studios for painters and sculptors. 

The event will shed light on the creative workshops and the individuals behind them, including Huszár Adolf, Zala György, Donáth Gyula, Vajda Zsigmond, Feszty Árpád, and Pállik Béla. Flamisch Péter, a talented guitarist, will provide musical interludes that will enhance our experience and help us evoke the grandeur and splendor that characterized the "palaces" of these artists. 

We will learn about the multifaceted Pállik, known as the painter of "philosophical sheep," the lavish receptions hosted by Feszty at his palace on Bajza utca, and the significance of something being described as "donáthul". It would be remiss not to mention the Strobl Alajos sculpture and the Benczúr Gyula painting school in the context of the art colony's history. We will also have the opportunity to view and appreciate some of the artworks that have survived from this era.

Görbe Márk, an art historian, will share his "epreskerti meséi" (tales of the Epreskert) during the evening, which will be complemented by Flamisch Péter's acoustic instrumental world music performance. Flamisch Péter identifies himself as a world musician and draws inspiration from the ocean and his seafaring adventures. His performances blend various styles and motifs, ranging from blues and folk music to electronic sounds. He will perform his instrumental compositions on the acoustic guitar, using different effect pedals and a looper.

The unique sound, rhythmic patterns, and musical transitions will take the audience on a mystical journey. 

Attendance to the event is free of charge! The Epreskert venue can be accessed from the gate located at the corner of Bajza and Kmety streets starting from 5:30 PM. (Photos: Sampár Anna, Szabó Aladár)

We invite you to join us for this captivating event, where art, history, and music intertwine to transport us to a bygone era. Don't miss out on this opportunity to explore the enchanting tales of the Epreskert!

 ### PHARRAJIMOS, A Roma Holokauszt Emléknapja

Title: PHARRAJIMOS: Remembrance Day for the Roma Holocaust

Description:

Join us on Wednesday, August 2, 2023, at 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM UTC+02 for PHARRAJIMOS, a Roma Holocaust Remembrance Day. This event is organized by Civil Bázis, in collaboration with the Magyarországi Roma Parlament, Egységes Diákfront, and SZOCSOMA.

On August 2nd, communities around the world, who stand in solidarity with the Roma people, commemorate the victims of the Roma Holocaust. On this day in 1944, nearly three thousand Roma were burned alive by the Nazi regime.

To honor their memory, we invite everyone to gather at the "Shoes on the Danube Bank" memorial, a site symbolic of the fascist terror that Hungary experienced. This event welcomes those who consider themselves victims of modern-day fascism, as well as those who stand in solidarity with them.

Let us show support for those who have been deprived of their livelihoods and homes, the hundreds of thousands who have been forced into segregated Roma settlements. Together, let us remind the government of the plight faced by those living in modern-day ghettos and "Roma concentration camps," where they suffer from hunger, cold, disease, and neglect.

We must stand up for those who have become victims of extremist ideologies propagated by politicians or paramilitary groups. Let us advocate for those trapped in degrading conditions of forced labor, where their survival depends on trampling one another.

Furthermore, let us support our children who are either attending ethnically segregated schools or have been expelled from them, and ensure their right to acquire the knowledge that is rightfully theirs. We must challenge the power abuses of fascist mayors and magistrates, fighting for the rights of those they oppress.

We need to raise our voices in defense of our silenced culture, our artists, and our intellectuals who endure unemployment or political servitude. Let us stand together at the "Shoes on the Danube Bank" memorial for the Roma people, for those stripped of their citizenship, homeland, and dignity, and for every human being.

And let us take off our shoes, symbolizing our commitment to remember and honor the Roma victims of the Holocaust.

We, the organizers, on behalf of the Roma Parlament, Egységes Diákfront, and Civil Bázis, await all compassionate individuals, both Roma and non-Roma, who believe in democracy.

Join us for PHARRAJIMOS, the Roma Holocaust Remembrance Day.

The Roma Holocaust, also known as the Porajmos, was a period during World War II when the Romani people were subjected to systematic persecution and extermination by Nazi Germany and its collaborators. It is estimated that between 220,000 to 500,000 Roma were victims of this genocide.

The Roma Holokauszt Megemlékezés aims to honor and remember the Roma victims of the Holocaust, ensuring that their stories are never forgotten. By organizing this event, the Romedia Foundation and other participating organizations seek to raise awareness about the historical significance of the Roma Holocaust and the ongoing struggle for recognition and justice.

The event will take place at the Roma Holocaust Memorial in Budapest, providing a solemn and meaningful space for reflection and remembrance. It is open to the public, welcoming individuals who wish to pay their respects and learn more about the Roma Holocaust.

Join the Roma Holokauszt Megemlékezés on August 2nd in Budapest to commemorate the Roma victims of the Holocaust and support the ongoing efforts to preserve their memory. Let us stand together in remembrance and solidarity.
