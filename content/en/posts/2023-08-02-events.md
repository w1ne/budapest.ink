 ### Utcáról utcára – Az Epreskert meséi

Title: "Explore the Stories of Epreskert - An Evening of Art and Music"

Date and Time: Wednesday, August 2, 2023, at 6:00 PM (UTC+02)

Location: Bajza utca 41, Budapest

Organizer: Eötvös10

Are you ready for a unique journey into the history and culture of Budapest? Join us on a summer afternoon in the shade of overgrown mulberry trees to discover the fascinating story of an extraordinary artists' colony known as Epreskert. 

Görbe Márk, an art historian, and Flamisch Péter, a talented guitarist, will take you back to the late 19th century when Budapest was experiencing a vibrant period of economic and cultural growth. It was during this time that a group of painters and sculptors established their studios on the outskirts of the city, giving birth to what would later become known as Epreskert.

During this time travel experience, you will learn about the lives and works of artists such as Huszár Adolf, Zala György, Donáth Gyula, Vajda Zsigmond, Feszty Árpád, and Pállik Béla, who were at the heart of this artistic community. Flamisch Péter's musical interludes will add a colorful dimension to the journey, allowing us to evoke the former glamour and opulence that characterized these artists' "palaces".

Discover why Pállik was known as the painter of "philosophical sheep," learn about the lavish receptions held at Feszty's palace on Bajza utca, and find out what it meant to be "donáthul". The history of the artists' colony wouldn't be complete without mentioning the sculpting school founded by Strobl Alajos and the painting school led by Benczúr Gyula. We will also have the opportunity to view and appreciate some of the remaining artworks from that time.

Görbe Márk's art historical narrative will be complemented by the unique acoustic world music performance of Flamisch Péter. As a world-traveling musician, Péter draws inspiration from his adventures at sea. His compositions blend different styles and motifs, ranging from blues to folk music and even electronic sounds. Using his acoustic guitar, various effect pedals, and a looper, Péter creates instrumental pieces that will take you on a mystical journey through sound and rhythm.

The event will take place at Epreskert, and admission is free for all attendees. You can enter the venue from the gate located at the corner of Bajza utca and Kmety utca, starting from 5:30 PM. Don't miss this opportunity to immerse yourself in the rich history and vibrant artistry of Budapest.

Please note: The event will be accompanied by photographs taken by Sampár Anna and Szabó Aladár.

We look forward to welcoming you to this unforgettable evening of art and music!

 ### PHARRAJIMOS, A Roma Holokauszt Emléknapja

PHARRAJIMOS, A Roma Holokauszt Emléknapja

Join us on Wednesday, August 2, 2023, from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM UTC+02, as we commemorate the Roma Holocaust Victims on the International Roma Holocaust Memorial Day. This event is organized by Civil Bázis in collaboration with the Hungarian Roma Parliament, the Unified Student Front, and SZOCSOMA.

On August 2, we remember the nearly three thousand Roma-Cigány individuals who were burned alive by fascism in 1944. In the spirit of this remembrance, we invite everyone to the memorial site of the victims shot into the Danube by the Arrow Cross terrorists, known as the "Shoes on the Danube Bank." We call upon those who consider themselves victims of present-day fascism and those who stand in solidarity with them.

Let us stand up for those stripped of their work and homes, and for the hundreds of thousands who have been banished to segregated Roma neighborhoods. We must remind the government of those suffering in today's ghettos, cramped in "Roma concentration camps," starving, freezing, tormented by illness, and abandoned to their fate.

We stand up for those who have become victims of extremist ideological politicians or their paramilitary units. We stand up for those forced into public work services, trampling over each other for survival and dignity. We stand up for our children who attend ethnically segregated schools or have been expelled even from there, fighting for their right to acquire knowledge.

It is time to speak out against the abuse of power by fascist mayors and officials. We must raise our voices for our silenced culture, our artists, and our intellectuals who are condemned to unemployment or political slavery. We stand up by the "Shoes on the Danube Bank" for the Roma people and all individuals who have been deprived of their citizenship rights, homeland, and dignity.

..and we take off our shoes!

On behalf of the organizers:
Roma Parliament 
Unified Student Front 
Civil Bázis

We welcome all well-intentioned Roma and non-Roma democrats to join us for this event.

 ### ROMA HOLOKAUSZT MEGEMLÉKEZÉS

**ROMA HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL**

Join us on Wednesday, August 2, 2023, at 4:30 PM UTC+02, as we come together to commemorate the Roma Holocaust victims at the Roma Holocaust Memorial. The event is organized by the Roma Holocaust Memorial Committee and will take place at Nehru Park in Budapest, Hungary (Budapest, IX. Nehru part).

Renowned artists such as Jónás Judit and Fatima, Lakatos Mónika and Rostás Mihály, Balogh József, Künsztler Ágnes, Pápai Rómeó and Lovas Emília, and the band of Reményi Géza, along with the young actors of Karaván Színház, will pay tribute to the events that took place 79 years ago.

The event is organized by the Romaversitas Foundation, Romedia Foundation, Uccu Foundation, Romano Instituto Foundation, and the Roma National Minority Self-Government of Budapest.

The Roma Holocaust Memorial is an important event that raises awareness about the genocide that targeted the Roma people during World War II. It serves as a reminder of the atrocities committed and honors the lives lost. By coming together and remembering, we strive for a more inclusive and tolerant society.

We invite everyone to join us and show their support for the Roma community and their resilience in the face of adversity. Let us stand united and remember the victims of the Roma Holocaust. Together, we can ensure that their stories are never forgotten.
