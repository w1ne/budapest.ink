 ### STILL CORNERS (UK) / Jerry Spin (BE)  // A38 Hajó

Name: STILL CORNERS (UK) / Jerry Spin (BE)  // A38 Hajó
Date and Time: None
Location: A38 Hajó, Petőfi híd, budai hídfő, Budapest
Organizer: A38 Hajó

The A38 Hajó in Budapest is excited to welcome back Still Corners on August 2nd. Tessa Murray and Greg Hughes, the duo behind Still Corners, are known for delivering the best soundtrack to accompany your travels, whether you're on a train or in a car. If you were lucky enough to catch their last performance, you'll have the chance to relive the experience. And if you missed it, now is your opportunity to experience live the captivating dream pop/synthpop sound of one of the most distinctive acts of our time.

Still Corners will be embarking on a summer tour across Europe to celebrate the 10th anniversary of their 2013 album "Strange Pleasures." This album has achieved cult status since its release, with its opening song "The Trip" capturing the hearts of people worldwide. With over 115 million plays on YouTube and almost 50 million plays on Spotify, it has become a virtual community for like-minded fans. The album's tracks, including "Fireflies," "Strange Pleasures," "Beginning to Blue," and "The Trip," have been featured in films and on television.

Tessa Murray has expressed her excitement about the anniversary tour, saying, "We wanted to celebrate with our fans, so we've organized a summer tour that starts on July 30th in Istanbul. We'll be revisiting some of our favorite songs from the album and will have special merchandise and vinyl available."

In addition to Still Corners, the event will also feature Jerry Spin, the musical alter ego of Belgian musician Jeroen De Gussem. Jerry Spin combines his lifelong passion for storytelling with music. His lyrics explore themes of love, life, loss, and memory, delving into the human condition, society, and the cyclical nature of history. His just-released debut EP, "Beasts," delves into the "beastly" and "egocentric" nature of humanity, with animal imagery and references to finance and politics. Jerry Spin's sound has drawn comparisons to Father John Misty, Arctic Monkeys, Gorillaz, Arcade Fire, and Tame Impala. Onstage, he is joined by vocalist, pianist, and composer Eline Flintrop, adding another dimension to their performance.

The event is supported by Liveurope, an organization that promotes up-and-coming European artists. 

Unfortunately, Portland will not be performing at the event. They have had to cancel their remaining festival appearances due to health reasons. Portland's lead singer, Jente, has been diagnosed with a brain injury that requires immediate treatment. Jente is taking a break to focus on their health and well-being. However, they assure fans that Portland will be back after summer with an even bigger and more powerful tour. They express gratitude for the support and ask for privacy and peace during this time.

Don't miss this incredible night of music at A38 Hajó in Budapest, featuring Still Corners and Jerry Spin. Get your tickets now and embark on a mesmerizing journey of sound.

 ### Utcáról utcára – Az Epreskert meséi

Title: "Street to Street - Tales from the Epreskert"
Date and Time: Wednesday, August 2, 2023, at 6:00 PM UTC+02
Location: Bajza utca 41, Budapest
Organizer: Eötvös10

Join us for a special evening as we delve into the history of a unique art colony at the Epreskert, set amidst the descendants of wild strawberry trees. This summer afternoon, under the shade of these trees, Görbe Márk, an art historian, and Flamisch Péter, a guitar virtuoso, will present a captivating story.

We will transport you back to the late 19th century, a time when Budapest's economic and cultural vibrancy also contributed to the creation of this artistic complex on the outskirts of the city. During this journey through time, we will explore the studios and personalities of artists such as Huszár Adolf, Zala György, Donáth Gyula, Vajda Zsigmond, Feszty Árpád, and Pállik Béla. Flamisch Péter's musical interludes will further enrich the experience, allowing us to rekindle the former glory and splendor that characterized the artists' "palaces."

You will discover why the versatile Pállik was known as the "painter of philosophical sheep," learn about Feszty's grand receptions at his Bajza Street palace, and understand the significance of something being described as "donáthul." The story of the art colony wouldn't be complete without mentioning the sculptor's school led by Strobl Alajos and the painting school led by Benczúr Gyula. We will also showcase artworks from this period that have survived and can be viewed on-site.

On this evening, Görbe Márk's "tales from the Epreskert" will be complemented by Flamisch Péter's acoustic instrumental world music performance. Flamisch Péter describes himself as a world music traveler, inspired by the ocean and his sailing adventures. His compositions blend various styles and motifs, ranging from blues to folk music and even electronic music. Using his acoustic guitar and a combination of effect pedals and a looper, he will mesmerize the audience with his instrumental pieces.

The unique sounds, rhythms, and musical transitions will take the listeners on a mystical journey. 

The event is free to attend! It will take place at Epreskert, and entrance will be available from 5:30 PM at the gate located at the corner of Bajza and Kmety streets.

Come and immerse yourself in the fascinating stories and enchanting music of the Epreskert art colony. Don't miss out on this free event that promises to transport you to a bygone era of artistic excellence and cultural vibrancy.

 ### PHARRAJIMOS, A Roma Holokauszt Emléknapja

PHARRAJIMOS, A Roma Holocaust Memorial Day

On Wednesday, August 2, 2023, at 3:00 PM, an event called PHARRAJIMOS, A Roma Holocaust Memorial Day will take place in Budapest, Hungary. Organized by Civil Bázis, the event is a collaboration between the Hungarian Roma Parliament, Civil Bázis, the Unified Student Front, and SZOCSOMA.

The world's democratic communities, in solidarity with the Roma people, commemorate the Holocaust Roma Victims on August 2nd. It was on this day in 1944 when nearly three thousand Roma and Gypsy individuals were burned alive by fascism.

In the spirit of this remembrance, everyone is invited to the memorial site of the "Shoes on the Danube Bank" at 3:00 PM. This event aims to gather those who consider themselves victims of modern fascism, as well as those who stand in solidarity with them.

Let us stand up for those who have been deprived of their work and homes, and for the hundreds of thousands of Roma people who have been forced into segregated slums. It is essential to remind the state of those who suffer in today's ghettos and "Gypsy concentration camps," where they endure hunger, cold, illness, and abandonment.

We must stand up for those who have become victims of extremist ideology and the paramilitary detachments of politicians. Let us advocate for those who are oppressed and trampled upon in the forced labor service, as they fight each other for survival.

We must support our children who are segregated in ethnically separated schools or even expelled from them, as they deserve access to knowledge. We need to speak out against the abuses of power by fascist mayors, and for the rights of those who suffer under their administrative tyranny.

We need to speak up for our silenced culture, our artists, and our intellectuals who are condemned to unemployment or political servitude. Let us stand up for the "Shoes on the Danube Bank," for the Roma people who have been deprived of their citizenship rights, their homeland, and their dignity, and for every human being.

And let us take off our shoes!

On behalf of the organizers:
Roma Parliament, Unified Student Front, Civil Bázis

We welcome all well-intentioned Roma and non-Roma democrats.
