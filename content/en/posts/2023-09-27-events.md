 ### Rényi András: Rembrandt mint drámaszerző | Gólyavári Esték

Join us for the next installment of the Gólyavári Esték (Freshman Castle Evenings), featuring a lecture by Rényi András titled "Rembrandt as a Playwright: Insights into the Performative Interpretation of Paintings". This unconventional lecture proposes a new method for observing and reinterpreting Rembrandt's mythological and biblical paintings and etchings. 

The hypothesis is that Rembrandt, exceptionally talented in both painting and drawing, also possessed the skills of a playwright and stage dramaturge. However, this aspect of his talent is rarely reflected upon in art historical literature. 

Traditionally, discussions about the paintings tend to abstract the depicted narratives as "iconographic subjects," often missing the way in which the artist transforms the pre-existing closed epic narratives into open-ended, here-and-now dramatic events, unintentionally adhering to the spirit of Aristotle's Poetics. 

In order to convey complex turning points within static images, Rembrandt had to develop an innovative syntax of pictorial stagecraft, in which the role of the so-called implicit viewer plays a crucial part. As real spectators, we must fulfill this role in order for the drama to unfold before our eyes, with our participation. 

The lecture will present two to three case studies to confirm the foundational theses of "Rembrandt-dramatology." 

Rényi András is a professor at the Faculty of Humanities of ELTE (Eötvös Loránd University) and has enriched the university's academic life since 2008 through his diverse teaching and research activities. 

The event will take place at ELTE Faculty of Humanities' Gólyavár (Freshman Castle), Mária Terézia room, located at 4 Múzeum körút, Budapest 1088.

Don't miss this opportunity to gain new insights into Rembrandt's work and the performative nature of his paintings. Join us for an engaging evening of art and discussion.
