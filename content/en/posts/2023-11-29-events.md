 ### Hidden Orchestra | Arms and Sleepers // A38 Hajó

Hidden Orchestra and Arms and Sleepers will be performing live at A38 Hajó on Wednesday, November 29, 2023, at 10:00 AM UTC+01. Hidden Orchestra, led by multi-instrumentalist/composer/producer Joe Acheson, is an imaginative orchestra created in his studio. Joe combines recordings from various guest musicians with field recordings, bass, and intricate layers of drums to create a unique musical experience. The live band consists of Joe on bass and electronics, drummer Jamie Graham, and other talented guest instrumentalists. The music is a fusion of different genres and influences, described as electronic music made with acoustic instruments and natural sounds. It is known for its contrasting elements, such as anxiety and calmness, darkness and lightness, and fast and slow rhythms. The abstract emotions conveyed in Hidden Orchestra's music allow the listener to interpret it in their own way. This year, after a pandemic hiatus, Hidden Orchestra's live band is returning with AV shows. During this time, Joe released the award-winning Creaks OST for Amanita Design, collaborated with Cerys Matthews and ten UK poets, and created outdoor sound/music installations in Kew Gardens' botanical forest at Wakehurst. The live performance will also feature immersive visuals by Tom Newell of Limbic Cinema.

Arms and Sleepers, an electronic music act founded in Boston, Massachusetts, in 2006, will also be performing at the event. The group, originally consisting of Max Lewis and Mirza Ramic, has since continued with Ramic as the sole official member. With over 30 releases, 2,500 live performances, and placements in TV and film music, Arms and Sleepers has established itself as a prominent musical act. In 2020, they released a 6-part conceptual music series, followed by re-releases and anniversary editions in 2021 to celebrate their 15th anniversary. In 2022, Arms and Sleepers released a new full-length album called 'former kingdoms', as well as a vinyl repress of their 2007 album 'Black Paris 86'. This year, they have released 3 EPs, singles, and remixes, collaborating with various artists. Their 14th studio album will be released in early 2024. Arms and Sleepers explores a range of genres, including trip-hop, electronica, downtempo, ambient, hip-hop, and pop. The duo has remixed songs for artists such as Emancipator, Robot Koch, and Sun Glitters, and has collaborated with notable musicians like Tom Brosseau, Serengeti, and Philip Jamieson. Arms and Sleepers' music has been licensed by major companies and platforms like Apple, Amazon, HBO, and Vice. The group has received positive coverage from music outlets and continues to create and perform music while also co-founding the artist-run record label, Future Archive Recordings.
