In addition to dancing, we also get to know the rich repertoire of talented folk singers and enjoy the energetic music of the most renowned bands in the táncház scene, ensuring a night of carefree entertainment.

 ### Túr de Rákosrendező X.

Join us for the 10th anniversary celebration of Túr de Rákosrendező X on Saturday, September 16, 2023! The event will kick off at 2:30 PM at Örs, where we will embark on a scenic route through the district, culminating in a festive gathering at Rákosrendező, near the recently completed overpass. 

It took nine Túr de Rákosrendező events and the collective effort of all participants to make this overpass a reality. Despite hearing countless times that it would remain unfinished, with some even arguing that the more challenging it is to cross, the better, as it would discourage cyclists, the MÁV finally listened to the requests of the community. 

Now it's up to the local government of Zugló to build a proper bike lane on a 200-meter stretch of Teleki Blanka út. 

Come and join us as we cycle together and show our determination to never give up until that section is completed! Let's celebrate this achievement together. We warmly welcome everyone who is interested to join us. See you there!
