 ### Giuseppe Verdi: ATTILA opera

The Margitszigeti Színház is proud to present Giuseppe Verdi's opera "Attila" on August 12th, 2023, at the Margitszigeti Szabadtéri Színpad in Budapest. The performance will start at 8:00 PM local time, with a rain date set for August 13th. The opera will be performed in Italian with Hungarian and English subtitles.

"Attila" is a captivating opera based on the legendary figure of Attila the Hun, whose story has been a constant source of inspiration for artists throughout history. While some historians have portrayed Attila as a ruthless barbarian, the writings of Priscus, a diplomat and historian who visited Attila's court, present a different perspective. According to Priscus, Attila was a charismatic and educated ruler, a skilled diplomat, and a thoughtful leader.

Verdi's portrayal of Attila in the opera reflects this nuanced depiction. He is depicted as a conqueror with a complex emotional world, capable of both love and resilience in the face of defeat. The story revolves around Attila's encounter with Odabella, a princess who becomes a captive in his camp. While Odabella initially appears to join forces with the conqueror, she has her own plans for Attila.

The libretto of "Attila" was written by Temistocle Solera and Francesco Maria Piave, drawing inspiration from Zacharias Werner's 1809 drama "Attila, König der Hunnen." The opera premiered on March 17th, 1846, at the La Fenice opera house in Venice. In Hungary, it was first performed on July 7th, 1972, and again on July 7th, 2004, at the Margitszigeti Szabadtéri Színpad.

The upcoming performance of "Attila" at the Margitszigeti Színház in 2023 will feature the internationally acclaimed Canadian bass John Relyea in the role of Attila and the distinguished Hungarian soprano Kolonits Klára as Odabella. The opera promises not only breathtaking vocal performances but also a visually stunning production that will create an unforgettable experience for opera enthusiasts.

Don't miss this extraordinary opportunity to witness the magic of Verdi's "Attila" brought to life on the stage of the Margitszigeti Szabadtéri Színpad. Get your tickets now for an evening of captivating drama, beautiful music, and mesmerizing performances.
