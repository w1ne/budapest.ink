 ### Prayer and Praise Night

Join us for a powerful evening of prayer and praise at the Riverside Church Budapest! On Monday, November 6, 2023, at 10:00 AM (UTC+01), we will gather together to lift our voices in worship and seek the presence of God.

Prayer and praise are essential elements of the Christian faith, and on this special night, we will come together as a community to offer our hearts, voices, and prayers to the Lord. This event is open to everyone, regardless of age or background. Whether you are a long-time believer or new to the faith, we invite you to come and experience the joy and power of prayer and praise.

During the evening, we will have a time of worship led by our talented music team. We will sing songs of adoration and thanksgiving, declaring God's goodness and faithfulness. Through music, we will create an atmosphere of worship where we can connect with God on a deeper level.

After the worship session, we will have a focused time of intercessory prayer. We will pray for our church, our city, our nation, and the world. This is an opportunity for us to come together and lift up our needs, concerns, and desires to God. Through prayer, we can make a difference in our lives and the lives of others.

Prayer and praise have the power to transform hearts, bring healing, and create unity. As we gather together, we believe that God will move in a powerful way, touching lives and answering prayers. This evening promises to be a time of spiritual renewal and encouragement.
