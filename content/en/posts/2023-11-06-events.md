 ### Prayer and Praise Night

Join us for a powerful and uplifting evening of prayer and praise at Riverside Church Budapest! On Monday, November 6th, 2023, at 10:00 AM UTC+01, we will come together to worship and seek God's presence.

During this special event, we will be focusing on the power of prayer and the importance of praising God. Prayer is a personal conversation with our Creator, and it has the ability to bring about transformation and healing in our lives. Praise, on the other hand, is an expression of gratitude and adoration for God's goodness and faithfulness.

If you are looking for a time of spiritual refreshing and an opportunity to connect with God on a deeper level, this Prayer and Praise Night is for you. It will be a time of genuine worship where we can draw near to God and pour out our hearts to Him.

The Prayer and Praise Night will be led by our passionate and anointed worship team, who will create an atmosphere of worship that will allow you to enter into God's presence. Through intimate times of prayer, uplifting songs, and powerful testimonies, we will seek God's guidance, peace, and breakthrough.

It doesn't matter where you are on your spiritual journey â€“ all are welcome to attend the Prayer and Praise Night. Whether you are a seasoned believer or someone exploring faith, this event is a great opportunity to experience the transformative power of prayer and praise.

Please mark your calendars for Monday, November 6th, 2023, at 10:00 AM UTC+01, and join us at Riverside Church Budapest for a night of prayer and praise. Let's come together as a community of believers to seek God's presence and encounter His love and power. We can't wait to worship with you!
