 ### Prayer and Praise Night

Come join us for an uplifting and inspirational evening of prayer and praise at the Prayer and Praise Night hosted by Riverside Church Budapest. This event will take place on Monday, November 6, 2023, at 10:00 AM UTC+01.

Gather together with fellow believers in a warm and welcoming atmosphere as we lift our voices in prayer and joyfully worship our Creator. Prayer is a powerful tool that connects us to God, and through this event, we will create a space for individuals to come together and seek His presence.

During the Prayer and Praise Night, we will have various worship leaders and pastors leading us in heartfelt prayer and dynamic praise songs. There will be moments of reflection, where individuals can pray individually, as well as times of communal prayer, where we will join together as one body to seek God's guidance and intercede for one another.

This event is open to everyone, regardless of your religious background or level of faith. Whether you're a seasoned prayer warrior or new to the concept of prayer, you are welcome to attend and experience the transformative power of prayer and praise.

Please note that the exact location of the event is yet to be announced. Make sure to follow Riverside Church Budapest on social media for updates and further information. We look forward to seeing you at the Prayer and Praise Night on November 6th!
