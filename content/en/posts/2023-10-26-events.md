 ### The Korean Salon at MOME: The World of K-pop 

The Korean Cultural Center in Hungary is hosting The Korean Salon at MOME: The World of K-pop on Thursday, October 26, 2023, at 8:00 AM UTC+02. This event is part of a lecture series on cultural theory that aims to explore the increasingly popular Korean cultural phenomena. The lectures delve into these topics in an accessible, critical, and experiential way while also providing a community experience for those interested in Korean culture.

The third part of the lecture series will focus on the world of K-pop, which is still at the center of global pop culture. The expert guest speaker, Gyu Tag Lee, will take attendees on a journey to understand the origins, genre, and cultural mix of K-pop. The presentation will also highlight the changes that K-pop has undergone since the 2020s and explore the existence of "non-Korean" formations within the genre. Additionally, the lecture will delve into how K-pop's global success has influenced other cultures and how they, in turn, influence K-pop.

Gyu Tag Lee, the lecturer, is an expert in popular music, media studies, globalization of culture, and particularly K-Pop. He obtained his bachelor's degree in English Language and Literature from Seoul National University, South Korea, and his master's degree in communication from the same university. He completed his Ph.D. in Cultural Studies at George Mason University in 2013. Since 2014, he has been teaching at George Mason University-Korea as an associate professor in the Global Affairs Program, specializing in Cultural Studies and Anthropology. He has published books and articles on K-Pop, popular music, and hallyu (the Korean wave) in various online and offline media platforms, and is also a committee member of the Korean Music Awards.

Following the lecture, there will be a live concert by the Korean band YaSiSi. The band, consisting of Yoo Ji-soo on vocals, Jo Eun-young on keyboards, and Lee Yoo on bass, covers Korean songs from the 1930s and 40s, which are considered the beginnings of K-pop.

Attendance to The Korean Salon at MOME: The World of K-pop is free of charge, but pre-registration is required. To secure your spot, please visit the registration link provided: [registration link]

Don't miss this opportunity to gain deeper insights into the fascinating world of K-pop and experience the live concert by YaSiSi. Join us at the MOME Filmstudio in Budapest for an enriching and enjoyable event.
