 ### Heinrich B√∂ll ‚Äì Berem√©nyi G√©za: Katharina Blum elvesztett tisztess√©ge

Heinrich B√∂ll ‚Äì Berem√©nyi G√©za: Katharina Blum's Lost Honor

Are you ready to dive into a bizarre story of lost honor? Join us on Tuesday, September 5, 2023, at 8:00 PM UTC+02 at V√°rosmajor in Budapest for an incredible performance of "Katharina Blum elvesztett tisztess√©ge" (Katharina Blum's Lost Honor) brought to you by the V√°rosmajori Szabadt√©ri Sz√≠npad.

Katharina Blum is the embodiment of success in the 1970s Western Europe, particularly in West Germany. This is the era of economic miracles and the mainstreaming of the student riots of '68. Katharina's life seems to be meticulously planned out, with German precision and post-war empathy: a secondary education, a secure and well-paying job as a housekeeper, a home, a used but functional car, ample free time, and few opportunities to fill it. She is also attractive and well-groomed, but despite all this, her life is a volatile mix of loneliness - both existential and sexual.

What more does she need to make her impeccably orderly life a little happier, even if only for a few hours? A one-night stand, of course. And it happens, or at least it should have happened. But due to one of the most twisty plot turns in history, the one-night stand remains just that - a single night - while love, or rather the pursuit of love, engulfs Katharina's life, her self-esteem, her innocence, and ultimately, her honor. It is devoured by the filth of the times, the passage of time, and the gutter press.

The play is based on the novel written by Heinrich B√∂ll (1917-1985), a German writer who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1972. B√∂ll served as a common soldier in World War II, and the war left an indelible mark on his life and his writing. His main theme explores West Germany's post-war economic and political recovery and its psychological aftermath. His characters, we can call them "thinking, struggling individuals," stumble hesitantly towards an uncertain future, lured by the false promises of the past, in an attempt to overcome an unbearable past.

Except for Katharina Blum, that is. She takes action and receives her deserved punishment.

Katharina Blum asks, "And I have just one more question. Couldn't the state do something to protect me from this filth? I'm asking you because you are governmental people. How can my lost honor be restored? Fine, I understand now that my interrogation was absolutely justified, even if I don't understand why there was so much prying into my life. But what I find incomprehensible is how the details of my own interrogation ‚Äì let's take the man-in-the-bed thing ‚Äì ended up in the Zeitung's knowledge? And where did all those twisted and gossipy opinions about me come from?"

Don't miss out on this powerful and thought-provoking performance of "Katharina Blum elvesztett tisztess√©ge" at V√°rosmajori Szabadt√©ri Sz√≠npad. Come and witness the gripping story of honor and its loss in a society driven by scandal and sensationalism.

 ### Orient√°ci√≥s napok a KVIK-en!

Dear First-Year Student,

First of all, we would like to warmly welcome you as a member of the KVIK community at our university! We are glad to have you here! If everything goes well, you will spend several years with us, so it is important for you to have a meaningful and smooth experience. Get informed, make connections, learn, and experience as much as you can so that you can become a responsible university citizen.

To help you with this, we have organized an orientation day called "L√©gy k√©pben!" (Stay Informed!), where you can familiarize yourself with the basics of being a KVIK student in a fun and interactive way. On this day, you will get a taste of:

- Language learning and self-development opportunities beyond your studies
- How the library operates
- Insights into the entrepreneurial world
- Sustainability challenges
- The sports and leisure opportunities on campus
- Various recreational and entertainment options
- Plus, you will also be our guest for a delicious BGE coffee!

It is important to know that the orientation day program is intentionally designed as a mini simulation of your university education and life. Therefore, the completion requirements are the same. Just think about it: during your university years, you will have "lectures" (which in this case are informative presentations) and participate in "interactive practical seminars" (which are the optional programs). By fully utilizing your opportunities and fulfilling your academic obligations, you will earn the well-deserved "document": your diploma or certificate.

In addition to the informative presentations, the orientation day provides you with the opportunity to participate in alternative programs. You can collect stamps at each station, and by participating in the closing program and earning credits, you can contribute to your studies here (you will receive a credit fulfillment certificate as a well-deserved "document"). If you take part in the quiz related to the information you have learned and rank among the top three, you will also receive a guaranteed gift!

We highly recommend that you do not miss the orientation day, as it is an integral part of your education. It is "compulsorily optional" to use a familiar term. You will gain valuable knowledge, which we will even give you credit for. There is only something to gain, isn't it?

Come and join us in the program, -√ì, -I√ì, -CI√ì, -√ÅCI√ì, -ORIENT√ÅCI√ì - take your seats, let the bell ring!

Program:
- September 5: Orientation day for Trade and Marketing undergraduate program
- September 6: Orientation day for Tourism-Hospitality undergraduate program
- September 7: Orientation day for Community Organization undergraduate program, FOSZK KM program, FOSZK TV program

See you there!

 ### T√ÅBORT≈∞Z Vol. 5

Join Us for T√ÅBORT≈∞Z Vol. 5 - A Picnic and Celebration of Summer with God!

Are you ready for some outdoor fun? T√ÅBORT≈∞Z is back and this time, it's happening in the great outdoors! Despite the summer slowly fading away like a plastic bag caught in the wind, we are not deterred from hosting a cozy praise picnic. So pack some snacks, sandwiches, and something to sip on, and let's make some joyful noise together!

But that's not all! This T√ÅBORT≈∞Z is a special occasion where you can get to know the distant, capital letter GOD who loves you just the way you are. Remember, you are Kenough! Join us at the beautiful Nagy R√©t on Margit Island and let's celebrate summer with God.

And here's a little bonus: if you're cool, bring another person along with you too! Let's gather at Nagy R√©t on Margit Island from 5:30 PM on September 5th. The event officially starts at 6 PM. Don't miss out because this is going to be the talk of the town for the next month!

Spread the word and see you there! #bpifi #nemvagyegyedul
