 ### Sena Dagadub // Napfonat // KOBUCI kert

Sena Dagadub and Napfonat are joining forces for a special evening at Kobuci kert in Budapest. This event is the perfect way to close out the summer and celebrate the talented Sena Dagadu.

Sena Dagadu is a Ghanaian-Hungarian singer who made a name for herself in the Hungarian music scene. She has been active for over 20 years, with her debut album "First One" becoming iconic in the early 2000s. Sena has released three solo albums and has also collaborated with various artists and bands, including Irie Maffia and Barabás Lőrinc Eklektric.

Despite her success, Sena remains a humble and down-to-earth artist. She effortlessly blends into different musical genres, from reggae to rock, disco to hip-hop. She is known for her catchy pop songs, but she also enjoys challenging herself with more meditative and introspective performances. This led her to create a new formation called Sena Dagadub, where she explores the spiritual and meditative side of her music.

The Sena Dagadub show combines Sena's smoky vocals with Jamaican dub and jazz flute, creating a unique and atmospheric experience. It's a departure from the typical three-minute songs, allowing the music to free-flow and create a sense of slowed-down reflection in the fast-paced world we live in.

Joining Sena Dagadub for this event is Napfonat, a unique addition to the Hungarian music scene. They debuted in the spring of 2021 with their album "Szól a világ," which was nominated for the Magyar Zenei Díj. Napfonat has performed at various festivals and venues, including Bánkitó, Fishing on Orfű, Művészetek Völgye, and more. They have collaborated with renowned Hungarian artist Palya Bea and have been recognized for their talent and creativity.

The members of Napfonat, Szalay Heni, Szarka Anita, Tóth Eszter, Tóth Orsi, and Volkova Krisztina, create a harmonious blend of voices that showcases their love for Hungarian and world music. Their thematic second album, inspired by the four elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Air), was released in spring 2023.

Tickets for this event can be purchased in advance through the online ticketing system or at the on-site ticket office for 3500 Ft. There will also be regular tickets available on the day of the concert until 5:00 PM for 4000 Ft. Don't miss this opportunity to experience the captivating performances of Sena Dagadub and Napfonat in the beautiful city of Budapest.

For more information about Napfonat, you can visit their Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/napfonatzen), Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/napfonatzene/), and YouTube channel (https://tinyurl.com/napfonat-yt).

It will be a rich collection that welcomes various artistic perspectives and styles.

The Resident Art Fair places a special emphasis on young artists, highlighting their fresh and innovative approaches.

All exhibitors at the fair are professional artists who engage with current artistic, visual, and social issues. They contribute actively to the contemporary art scene in Hungary, both as creators and exhibitors. Alongside emerging and young artists, the fair will also feature established and successful artists who have made a name for themselves in the art world. Additionally, some artists will have their first opportunity to showcase their work in the art market.

The Resident Art Fair aims to engage not only those already familiar with the contemporary art scene, but also individuals who are interested in exploring the latest artistic trends. The fair offers a guiding hand to those who wish to navigate the vast "visual noise" and make informed choices about the artworks they surround themselves with. It serves as a source of inspiration and guidance for those who are just beginning their journey into the diverse world of contemporary art.

Over the past five years, Resident Art has organized 12 fairs, providing a platform for hundreds of artists and thousands of artworks to be showcased. Many first-time art buyers have made their purchases at these fairs, taking their first step into the world of contemporary art appreciation. Likewise, numerous artists have sold their work at Resident Art before transitioning into the world of contemporary galleries.

 ### The Tiger Lillies, Julian Crouch és Phelim McDermott: Jógyerekek képeskönyve

Join The Tiger Lillies, Julian Crouch, and Phelim McDermott for a unique theatrical experience in Budapest on Thursday, September 7, 2023, at 8:00 PM UTC+02. The event, titled "Jógyerekek képeskönyve" (The Picture Book of Good Children), will take place at Városmajori Szabadtéri Színpad.

The show delves into the question: what happens to a child if they play with matches, suck their thumb, refuse to comb their hair or trim their nails, rock on the chair, decline to eat their soup, constantly kick their legs, come close to the edge of the pool, run into the street, or engage in conversation with strangers? These situations often call for well-known "parental advice" that has been repeated throughout the years.

In 1845, Dr. Heinrich Hoffman, the chief physician of a mental institution in Frankfurt, wrote a collection of fairy tales in verse as a Christmas gift for his three-year-old son, Carl. Titled "Der Struwwelpeter" (Shockheaded Peter), it featured scary illustrations. The book became a huge success, and it was later translated into English by Mark Twain in 1848. Its Hungarian version, "Kócos Peti," has been both entertaining and frightening children for over a century, with eccentric parents using it to discipline their misbehaving kids.

From this collection of terrifying tales, the internationally renowned band The Tiger Lillies created a stage adaptation that defies genre classification. We could call it a horror vaudeville for adults, a junk opera, a grotesque musical revue, or a terrifyingly hilarious musical theater experience. Whether you've raised children or not, you will find something relatable in this show, either reflecting on your own mischievous childhood or recognizing your disobedient child. It's a performance that offers valuable insights to both parents and those who have yet to raise children.

Come and immerse yourself in the dark and twisted world of "Jógyerekek képeskönyve" by The Tiger Lillies, Julian Crouch, and Phelim McDermott. This theatrical event promises to be a mesmerizing, thought-provoking, and entertaining experience like no other. Get your tickets now and see how this twisted picture book unfolds on stage.

 ### Kiállításmegnyitó | Imaginációs gyakorlatok – MAYER Éva képzőművész kiállítása

Title: Kiállításmegnyitó | Imaginációs gyakorlatok – MAYER Éva képzőművész kiállítása

Description: Explore the captivating world of artist Éva Mayer at the Kiállításmegnyitó | Imaginációs gyakorlatok – MAYER Éva képzőművész kiállítása. This exhibition is a continuation and further exploration of Mayer's graphic installations and series which she began around five years ago. The exhibition delves into themes of faith, privacy, public scrutiny, personal values, societal norms, contradictions, personal traumas, and taboo topics. Mayer's unique graphic and painting techniques, combining glass, watercolor materials, scanning, development, and 3D modeling, elevate her personal experiences and traumas to a universal level. 

Article:

Are you ready to immerse yourself in a world of imagination and creativity? Well, mark your calendars for Thursday, September 7th, 2023, as the Kiállításmegnyitó | Imaginációs gyakorlatok – MAYER Éva képzőművész kiállítása takes place in Budapest. Organized by Hegyvidék Galéria, this event promises to be an evening filled with art, exploration, and thought-provoking visuals.

Éva Mayer, an accomplished artist, invites you to experience her latest exhibition, which runs from September 7th to 30th, 2023. Building on her previous graphic installations and series, Mayer's artwork explores various topics such as faith, privacy, public opinion, personal values, societal norms, and the contradictory relationships between personal traumas and taboo questions.

At the heart of Mayer's work are themes of hope, acceptance, letting go, providence, and the desire to care. Her pieces delve into motherhood, the anticipation and absence of children, and the traumas associated with these experiences. Through her own developed graphic and painting techniques, Mayer combines glass, watercolor materials, scanning, developing, and 3D modeling to create extraordinary and experimental graphics.

Mayer's artwork lifts her personal experiences and traumas to a universal level. Through visual elements, conversations with fate and female companions, and anonymous questionnaire responses from both childless and motherly individuals, she presents her personal stories and emotions, converting them into universal messages.

The exhibition features a variety of Mayer's works, including pieces with honeycomb motifs, complex symbol systems, and elements borrowed from the micro and macro world. These works provoke questions about fertility, order and disorder, destruction and purification, faith and hope, acceptance and letting go, and the arrangement and understanding of things. They also allude to growth and successful conception.

Considered an integral part of an imaginative practice, Mayer's exhibited works represent her previous memories and future desires, helping to facilitate their realization through healing internal imagery.

Éva Mayer, born in 1983 in Pozsony (Bratislava), currently resides and works in Somorja and Budapest. She completed her studies in graphic art and visual education at the Hungarian University of Fine Arts in 2008 and obtained her doctoral degree from the same institution in 2018. Mayer has received recognition for her professional work, including the Munkácsy Prize in 2013. Her exhibitions regularly feature in various forums in Slovakia, Hungary, and abroad. Besides her artistic pursuits, Mayer is also a cultural organizer, with several curatorial projects under her name. She is the creator and main organizer of the DUNARTCOM Somorja International Art Colony, which has been active since 2011. Additionally, she is a lecturer at universities and currently holds the position of college lecturer at the Media Design Department of Budapest Metropolitan University.

For those interested in delving deeper into Mayer's artistic world, the exhibition provides additional opportunities. On Thursday, September 14th, 2023, Mayer herself will guide visitors through her artwork. And on Thursday, September 21st, 2023, there will be an imaginative journey to the Inner Child led by clinical psychologist Orsolya Elekes-Czaga.

All events take place at the Hegyvidék Galéria, located at Királyhágó tér 10, Budapest.

Participation in the exhibition opening on September 7th, 2023, and the viewing of the exhibition are free of charge.
