 ### V√ÅROSH√ÅZA KERTMOZI: OPPENHEIMER

Join us for an extraordinary cinematic experience under the stars at V√°rosh√°za Kertmozi! In collaboration with Budapest Kertmozi and V√°rosh√°za, we present V√ÅROSH√ÅZA KERTMOZI, a series of outdoor film screenings in the beautiful courtyard of the City Hall.

"Oppenheimer" tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a physicist who, along with his colleagues, including Hungarian-born Edward Teller and Leo Szilard, led the Manhattan Project, which was responsible for creating the first atomic weapon. This invention changed the course of history during World War II and likely prevented a full-scale armed conflict between the two superpowers in the second half of the 20th century, known as the Cold War.

The film features an exceptional cast, including Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, Jack Quaid, Kenneth Branagh, and Scott Grimes.
