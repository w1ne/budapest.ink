 ### FTC-Rail Cargo Hungaria - CSM Bucuresti (felk√©sz√ºl√©si m√©rk≈ëz√©s)

Attention handball fans! An exciting pre-season match is coming up between FTC-Rail Cargo Hungaria and CSM Bucuresti. The match will take place at the Elek Gyula Arena in Budapest, Hungary. The Elek Gyula Arena is a well-known sports and event venue that is home to various sports clubs, including the Ferencv√°rosi Torna Club.

The history of the arena dates back to when the Ferencv√°ros handball team played their matches in a small hall called the Fah√°z, which had a capacity of 200 spectators. For more important matches, they used the Budapest Sport Arena and the Electric N√©pf√ºrd≈ë Street Hall. Construction of the current arena, originally intended to be the Ganz Sports Arena, was halted for a long time, with only the building frame standing. In 1995, construction work resumed specifically for FTC, and the arena was completed in 1997.

The Elek Gyula Arena hosted its grand opening on February 23, 1997. The first match featured the Ferencv√°ros women's handball team, who defeated the Kisv√°rda team 33-10. This was followed by a women's basketball match, with the Ferencv√°ros team winning against Zala Vol√°n 83-62.

Between 2010 and 2012, the arena was named the F≈ët√°v-FTC Handball Arena after the team's sponsor. However, on August 31, 2012, it was officially renamed the Elek Gyula Arena as a tribute to Elek Gyula, a legendary handball coach from Ferencv√°ros. The arena's name plaque was unveiled by two former exceptional handball players from the club, Giba M√°rta and Bogn√°r Erzs√©bet, who won the World Championship with the national team in 1965.

Don't miss the FTC-Rail Cargo Hungaria versus CSM Bucuresti pre-season match at the Elek Gyula Arena. Mark your calendars for Tuesday, August 8, 2023 at 6:00 PM local time (UTC+02). Get ready to witness some thrilling handball action as these two teams prepare for the upcoming season. It's guaranteed to be an exciting event that handball fans won't want to miss.

 ### Vibe Changers x Palya Bea √ó Andrew Hefler

Vibe Changers x Palya Bea √ó Andrew Hefler @ V√°rosliget, Budapest (Tuesday, August 8, 2023 at 7:00 PM ‚Äì 10:00 PM)

Are you ready for the most exciting music event in the country? Join us at the Magyar Zene H√°za Szabadt√©ri sz√≠npad for Vibe Changers, the bravest musical party in town! This unique event, brought to you by Budapest's two most renowned improvisational groups, Random Trip and Seven Seconds In The Future, combines a club night series with a talent show. 

Vibe Changers focuses on the art of improvisation, where the evening begins with the hosts jamming together with special guest musicians. In the second part of the night, aspiring singers, rappers, and instrumentalists have the opportunity to join the founding members of the club on stage for an open mic session. Within the framework of a few rounds of musical games, the jury, consisting of the audience and the band, will determine who can create the strongest vibe and best match the music throughout the evening. 

This event will feature special guests Palya Bea and Andrew Hefler, adding their unique talents to the mix. It's important to note that admission for participants is free! Simply sign up at the ticket office before the concert starts.

The co-founders of Random Trip and Seven Seconds In The Future, Delov J√°vor and Nagy Krist√≥f, explain that the emphasis of Vibe Changers is not on virtuosity, but rather on that invisible vibration that often emanates from our favorite artists and gives us goosebumps, makes us dance, brings tears to our eyes, or puts us in a better mood. Through this musical game, Vibe Changers aims to bring back the champions of each event on a regular basis, allowing them to compete for a chance to perform at Paloznaki Jazzpiknik and a big concert by Random Trip in 2023.

Here are the rules of the game: 
1. A maximum of 12 performers can participate throughout the evening.
2. Arrive on time to register in your chosen category (singer, rapper, instrumentalist) as we aim to have a roughly equal number of participants in each category for the first round.
3. If you miss out on the competition for the day, you can pre-register for the next event.
4. There will be three rounds throughout the evening, with the most energetic performers advancing to the next round each time.
5. There will be two winners in the finals:
  - The first-place winner will be decided by the jury and will have the opportunity to perform at a big concert by Random Trip, as well as receive the main prize, which is 15,000 Ft worth of consumption at the Magyar Zene H√°za on the night of the competition.
  - The winner of the audience vote will also receive 1 point, giving them the chance to perform with the Random Trip team.
6. The overall winner of the game will be the player with the most points accumulated during the Vibe Changers events.

The main prize for the top three players, who showcase the best flow as singers, rappers, or instrumentalists, includes the opportunity to perform at the Paloznaki Jazzpiknik festival, a three-day festival pass, and additional prizes such as Audio-Technica microphones and a KORG headphones, courtesy of Audmax Kft.

The event will take place at the Magyar Zene H√°za Szabadt√©ri sz√≠npad. In case of rain, the concert will still proceed as the outdoor stage is covered. If the event is sold out, we recommend checking the official TicketSwap platform for previously purchased but now available tickets at fair prices and with complete safety.

Come and experience the vibrant energy of Vibe Changers! Visit the Magyar Zene H√°za website for more information about the program and upcoming concerts. See you there!
