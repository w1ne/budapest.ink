 ### Boiled Ink

Boiled Ink - A Unique Musical Journey

Are you ready for a musical experience like no other? Join us on Monday, November 20, 2023, at 12:00 PM UTC+01 for a captivating performance by the extraordinary duo, Boiled Ink.

Boiled Ink is not your typical music project. It all began in December 2019, when Joe and Matej met by chance at a local community bar in Budapest's vibrant 8th district. Joe, a talented songwriter and guitarist, was lost in his own musical world when his melodies caught the attention of Matej on the bass guitar.

Intrigued by Joe's songs, Matej suggested collaborating and working on the music together. Initially hesitant, Joe eventually agreed, saying, "I don't know, man, these songs are kind of personal to me, but hey, why not, let's give it a shot. We can start with three songs and see where we end up."

Little did they know that their musical partnership would blossom into something truly remarkable. Over the course of countless jam sessions and inspired songwriting sessions, Boiled Ink evolved into a dynamic duo ready to bring their music to the world.

One of the most fascinating aspects of Boiled Ink's music is its eclectic nature. Drawing influence from a wide range of genres and styles, their songs are a fusion of jazz, hip hop, rap, rock, samba, classical music, and even possess a strong musical character in their latest material. Each composition is a testament to the vast array of musical influences that have shaped the duo's unique sound.

With their profound lyrics, soulful vocals, and masterful guitar and bass work, Boiled Ink's performances are bound to leave a lasting impression on all who listen. Their music has a personal touch that resonates deeply with the audience, creating an intimate and immersive experience.

If you're searching for an incredible musical journey that transcends genres and captivates your senses, then Boiled Ink is a must-see. Join us for an unforgettable performance by this extraordinary duo. We promise you won't be disappointed.
