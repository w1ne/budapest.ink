 ### Magick Monday - Discover Your True Self, Make Friends, Drink Tea 

# Magick Monday - Discover Your True Self, Make Friends, Drink Tea 

Are you ready to uncover the secrets of an ancient spiritual path and tap into your true potential? Join us for Magick Monday at the ANT Collective in Budapest every Monday from 18:30 to 21:30. Hosted by George Farley from How To Be A Conscious Human, this event is designed to guide you in developing your consciousness and exploring the wonders of magic in a practical way.

This week's theme is "Lunar Consciousness," where you'll have the opportunity to engage in meditations, simple rituals, and psychic senses training. Whether you're new to magic or already on a spiritual journey, this event offers a space for everyone to learn, grow, and connect with like-minded individuals.

But what exactly is magic? Is it a religion? Magic, or Magick, traces back to ancient Sumeria and has traveled through various cultures before arriving in modern times. Unlike a religion, magic doesn't require specific beliefs or idol worship. It's a spiritual path that encourages self-discovery, healing, and personal transformation.

During the sessions, you'll delve into the history of magic, its practices, and how it can enhance your well-being. From healing techniques to divination tools like tarot cards and i ching, you'll have the chance to explore different aspects of magic without the need to change your existing belief system.

If you're curious about predicting the future or communicating with spirits, this event will provide insights into these topics in a respectful and inclusive environment. Rest assured, there's no demon summoning or cursing involved - just an open-minded exploration of consciousness and spirituality.

The exchange for this transformative experience is 3000 HUF (cash only for now), and don't forget to bring a notebook to jot down your insights and reflections. Whether you're a seasoned practitioner or a newcomer to magic, Magick Monday welcomes all individuals seeking personal growth, connection, and inner peace.

Join us at the ANT Collective (Tisza utca 11, Budapest, Hungary, 1133) and embark on a journey of self-discovery, friendship, and, of course, tea. George Farley, your host and a dedicated ceremonial magician, is eager to guide you on this path of exploration and insight. See you there!
