 ### »ARTISTS UNITE!(?)« - Why and how to start an Art Collective

**»ARTISTS UNITE!(?)« - Why and how to start an Art Collective**

Are young artists still willing to give up part of their spotlight in favor of a collective? In today's hyper-individualistic society driven by social media, this question holds significant importance. The Első Szalon, in collaboration with the INDA Gallery, is organizing an exhibition-based talk titled "»ARTISTS UNITE!(?)« - Why and how to start an Art Collective" to delve into this topic.

Taking place at the INDA Gallery, located at Király u. 34 II/4, 1061 Budapest, the event will feature a discussion between the deff collective - founded in 2023 by Sveta Maximova and Cora Sun - and Zsolt Kozma, the curator of the INDA Gallery. The talk will be moderated by Emese Kató and J. Adisdidene.

The aim of this talk is to explore the concept of the artist collective and its relevance in today's art world. Historically, artist collectives have served as intentional contradictions to the establishment of the individualistic and predominantly white and male artistic genius that the art market has long favored. However, in the face of social media-driven hyper-individualism, it begs the question of whether young artists are still willing to embrace collectivism.

Furthermore, the event draws inspiration from the ongoing exhibition at the INDA Gallery titled "GLIMPSES OF THE 1990S," which showcases works by Lajos Csontó, Róza El-Hassan, and András Ravasz. The 90s is considered by many as a decade where collective experiences and creations in art and culture thrived, representing perhaps the last moment in history where this was truly possible.

If you're interested in exploring the role of art collectives and the significance of collective creation in today's society, don't miss this exhibition-based talk at the INDA Gallery on Saturday, 11th November 2023, at 2:30 pm. It promises to be an insightful and thought-provoking discussion.

For more information about the INDA Gallery, please visit their official website at [https://indagaleria.hu](https://indagaleria.hu).
