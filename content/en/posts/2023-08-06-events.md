During the hike, we will provide guidance along the route and ensure a positive atmosphere. We also offer free rental of specialized carriers, flexible wraps, PikkPakk Premium waist bags, and Möbius tube tops, which can be reserved separately. Our tour guide, who has more than 8 years of active babywearing experience and over 5000 km of hiking with babies, will assist with adjusting the carriers and answer any questions related to babywearing and hiking.

We will document the hike with a professional camera, and you will have the opportunity to keep the hike's report for future reminiscing of the memories you created with your baby.

This hike is not limited to moms only; anyone who enjoys hiking with a babywearing group is welcome to join us.

 ### Önátadás MEDITÁCIÓ minden hétfő este - INGYENES | Facebook

**Önátadás MEDITÁCIÓ minden hétfő este - INGYENES | Facebook**

Join us every Monday evening for a transformative meditation experience, completely free of charge. The event is called "Önátadás MEDITÁCIÓ" and it will be held online.

**Date and Time:** Monday, July 24, 2023, from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM UTC+02

During this meditation session, we will explore the process of self-surrender, which is one of the most powerful choices we can make in life. As David R. Hawkins once said, "The essence of the three great paths of the heart [love], mind [meditation], and deed [service] is the process of self-surrender."

Participants of previous sessions have shared profound experiences:

"One of the group meditations was an experience like no other. After a few minutes, tears started streaming down my face. I couldn't understand why because there was no reason for me to cry, but the tears just kept flowing. It wasn't accompanied by any images or thoughts, just me and my tears. At the same time, a warm and comforting feeling washed over me, as if someone whispered, 'I love you, you are valuable.' I embraced myself in my imagination." (A. Zsuzsanna)

"During the meditation, I initially experienced interestingly pleasant physical sensations. Then my heart started pounding intensely, and I thought it would jump out of my chest. After that, a feeling of happiness overwhelmed me, something I hadn't felt in a long time. Joy, happiness, lightness... I felt like I was floating in space. The effects lasted for hours." (G. Zsuzsanna)

Both participants had previously gone through the MAP (Mentorship for a Purposeful Life) program when they had these experiences.

The intention of these meditations is to bring to the surface any emotional and mental obstacles that are blocking love and joy in your life and to help you release them. As the process unfolds, you will gain access to your full power while strengthening your trust in yourself and in life.

Meditating in a group environment makes the practice more powerful, as the collective energy boosts the effect. Additionally, the spiritual aspect enhances the impact of the meditation.

These meditation sessions do not require any prior knowledge or training. Just come as you are and be open to the experience.

**Important Note**: Please make sure to join the session before 19:05 as you will not be able to join after that time.

Location: The meditation will be held online at [https://meet.google.com/ddq-ztpg-ibr](https://meet.google.com/ddq-ztpg-ibr)

For more updates and information about the meditations, join my Facebook group: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/imonkova](https://www.facebook.com/groups/imonkova)

Looking forward to meditating with you.

With love,
Imre
