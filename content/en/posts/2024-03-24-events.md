 ### SUB.LAB.PRO - Barnaby Booth (UK): Never Get to Heaven

### Live Performance by SUB.LAB.PRO - Barnaby Booth (UK): Never Get to Heaven

**Date and Time:** Sunday, March 24, 2024, at 8:00 PM CET

**Location:** Traf√≥ House, Budapest

Join us for a captivating evening as **Barnaby Booth**, the award-winning choreographer and light designer from the UK, presents *Never Get to Heaven*. This performance follows the lives of ten individuals over a span of twenty-four hours. Through the play of light and intricate movements, it delves into the workings of hope and how it evolves hour by hour.

Picture this: It's 2 AM, one person sits alone while another navigates through a crowd. Arguments clash, relationships dissolve, laughter echoes as personal decisions are made, enlightenment strikes, and despair looms. An encounter with an angel in a club restroom sets the stage for a series of intertwining narratives.

As morning breaks, the sun rises, and the light shifts, revealing a new perspective on life. Booth's work, inspired by spirituality and the supernatural, explores mental health, societal interactions, and the essence of human connections.

*SUB.LAB.PRO* presents *The Ensemble Program*, a creative platform spanning nine months for emerging dancers. Mimicking a professional company structure, it equips ensemble dancers with the tools needed to thrive in the arts industry. *Never Get to Heaven* marks the third showcase of the 2023/2024 Ensemble season.

Featuring the talents of *Axelle Sechao, √Åsa Sigr√∫nard√≥tt√≠r, Boris Charrion, Elisa Picq, Emma Delvac, In√©s Grima, Mar Serra Mart√≠, Mel√©n Constant, Michela Centon, Nerya Zahavi*, among others, this performance promises to be a mesmerizing exploration of human experiences.

Don't miss this opportunity to witness a blend of movement, light, and sound orchestrated by Barnaby Booth, accompanied by the musical compositions of Joel Harries, and brought to life by an ensemble of talented performers.
