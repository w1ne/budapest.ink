 ### Guided tour by Delia Vekony, director of HAB

### Guided Tour by Delia Vekony - A Journey Through Artistic Collaboration

**Date and Time:** Wednesday, August 7, 2024 at 6:00 PM CEST

Are you ready to embark on a captivating journey through the world of art and creativity? Join us on August 7th for an exclusive English guided tour led by Delia Vekony, the director of Hungarian Art & Business (HAB). Delia Vekony will unravel the intriguing tale of an extraordinary artistic collaboration that transcended boundaries across the Iron Curtain.

This unique narrative revolves around two key figures - the op-art legend Victor Vasarely and the geometric abstraction enthusiast JÃ¡nos FajÃ³. Despite their different backgrounds and artistic styles, Vasarely and FajÃ³ shared a deep appreciation for the power of modern aesthetic forms. Their collaboration resulted in an exquisite collection of works, including screen prints and multiples, that are not only a testament to their talent but also a significant part of Vasarely's artistic legacy.

Vasarely, known for his global perspective and ambition to conquer the world through art, strategically used his popular art to challenge the anti-abstractionist stance of the Soviet establishment during the Cold War. FajÃ³, on the other hand, seized the opportunity presented by the private art market revival in the 1980s to showcase their collaborative works.

This enlightening exhibition sheds light on the untold story of Vasarely and FajÃ³, featuring works that have never been displayed together before. Don't miss this incredible opportunity to witness the fusion of artistic vision and cultural significance.

The event is free to attend, making it accessible to all art enthusiasts and curious minds. Come and be a part of this immersive experience where history, art, and creativity converge to inspire and enlighten. See you there!
