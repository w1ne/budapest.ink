Wondering if you can acquire the ability to heal yourself and others through magic? The answer is a resounding yes. Magic offers a myriad of techniques that can aid in addressing physical, psychological, and spiritual ailments, fostering holistic well-being. And the best part? You don't need to alter your existing belief system to partake in this enlightening journey.

Hosted at the ANT Collective in Budapest, Hungary, Magic Mondays are open to individuals of all backgrounds, beliefs, and levels of skepticism. Whether you're a seasoned spiritual seeker or a curious newcomer, you're welcome to join us on this transformative expedition. The exchange for this enlightening experience is 3000 HUF (cash only for now), and don't forget to bring along a notebook to capture your insights.

Meet your guide, George Farley - a seasoned ceremonial magician, philosopher, and consciousness explorer. His passion for sharing the wisdom of magic and fostering inner peace and insight shines through in every session. So mark your calendars for Monday, July 1, 2024, from 6:30 PM to 9:30 PM CEST, and get ready to unlock your mind, discover your true self, and interact with a community of like-minded individuals at Magic Mondays.

# DISCOVERY - Exhibition by Zsuzsa Szváth on the Kempinski Promenade Gallery

### When and Where
- **Date and Time:** Monday, July 1, 2024, 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM CEST
- **Location:** Kempinski Promenade Gallery, Kempinski Hotel Corvinus Budapest

### Event Details
For the second time, the solo exhibition "Discovery" showcasing the captivating works of painter Zsuzsa Szvath is now live at the Kempinski Promenade Gallery in Budapest. This exhibition, unveiled on June 4, will be available for viewing until the end of September 2024 on the ground floor of Kempinski Hotel Corvinus Budapest.

Zsuzsa Szvath's 'DISCOVERY' series delves into metaphorical imagery, reflecting people's emotions, fears, and hopes. Through her surreal paintings, she explores the hidden aspects of human existence, seeking connections, truth, and the essence of human values.

Born in 1972 in Pécs, Zsuzsa Szvath pursued her studies at the Hungarian University of Applied Arts (MOME) from 1993 to 1998, culminating in her diploma. Following this, she spent a year studying at the Universität der Künste (UdK) in Berlin in 1997, further enriching her artistic perspective.

A highlight in Zsuzsa Szvath's career was her solo exhibition titled 'A Period of Change,' held in September 2023 at the Rosenhang Museum in Germany. Notably, one of the paintings from this exhibition, 'JULIA RISES TO THE CLOUDS,' was inspired by the Hungarian band Napoleon Boulevard's hit song 'Júlia Does Not Want to Walk on the Ground.'

The 'A Period of Change' series received substantial acclaim, with publications in the German-language art magazine 'ARTProfil Kunstmagazin,' issues 150_2023 and 151_2023. Some pieces from this remarkable series are now on display as part of the Budapest exhibition.

Cristina Streckfuß, a respected curator and communication expert, praised Zsuzsa Szvath's distinctive creative style, emphasizing her ability to convey lost values, emotions, and ancient trust through her surreal and metaphorical worlds. The 'A Period of Change' series features one or two protagonists set against floating landscapes or urban scenes, evoking a sense of quiet restlessness juxtaposed with the depicted individuals' apparent calmness and carefree demeanor.

Don't miss the opportunity to immerse yourself in Zsuzsa Szvath's unique artistic universe at the 'Discovery' exhibition on the Kempinski Promenade Gallery. It's a chance to explore the depths of human emotion and connection through the lens of a truly talented artist.
