 ### Séta kilátással - a Rózsadomb legendái /helytörténeti séta/

Join us for a fascinating historical walk through the Rózsadomb neighborhood in Budapest, Hungary. Discover the secrets and legends of this young yet intriguing area, which was once considered a remote hill but later became an integral part of the city's landscape.

During this one and a half to two-hour walk, we will delve into the history of Rózsadomb and explore how it became connected to the rest of Budapest with the construction of the Margaret Bridge. As we wander through the winding streets of this neighborhood, we will learn about renowned figures such as Gyula Illyés, who made Rózsadomb his home, and János Kádár, whose "puritan" villa still stands as a testament to the area's rich past.

We will also visit the legendary home of the Bródy family and discover the dark chapter of Budapest's history when Adolf Eichmann, one of the key architects of the Holocaust, lived in this neighborhood. Our walk will conclude at the statue of Mansfeld Péter, a young hero from Buda, where we will bid farewell to our fellow explorers.

Join us on October 10th at 5:00 PM at the József-hegyi lookout point for an insightful and immersive historical experience. We look forward to welcoming everyone with open arms. Don't miss out on this opportunity to uncover the hidden stories of Rózsadomb! See you there!

 ### Fiatal felnőttek vidékre költöznek – Kollár-Klemencz Kamara koncert 

Young adults moving to the countryside - Kollár-Klemencz Chamber Concert

On Tuesday, October 10, 2023, from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM UTC+02, there will be a special event organized by Európa Pont called "Young adults moving to the countryside - Kollár-Klemencz Chamber Concert." The event will take place at Európa Pont, and the central topic for discussion will be the phenomenon of young adults increasingly choosing to settle in rural areas instead of the bustling city life.

Have you ever wondered what motivates someone to leave the city behind and start a new life in the countryside? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this lifestyle? What challenges, quality of life, job opportunities, and conditions come with living in the countryside? Is it more favorable in terms of sustainability, economy, or health? How does self-sufficiency work?

If you're interested in this topic and have perhaps considered starting a new life in the countryside, away from the noise of the city, this event is for you. Come and listen to the discussion to learn more about how and why it's worth taking the plunge.

After the discussion, you will have the opportunity to enjoy the Kollár-Klemencz Chamber's performance of their production "The River."

We have invited the following guests to share their experiences and expertise:

- Alexandra Nagy - an actress and presenter who moved from Budapest to a small village in Nógrád County two years ago.
- Luca Bródy / Herstory Collective - their project aims to collect and make visible the stories and realities of women in relation to rural life, self-sufficiency, and the interconnected care crisis.
- László Kollár-Klemencz - a landscape architect, film director, screenwriter, and musician. He became known as the singer, songwriter, and lyricist of the Kistehén band. Currently, he is the frontman and songwriter for the Kollár-Klemencz Chamber and has authored three books. He lives in Szentendre, but spent most of his childhood in Újhartyán, a village in Pest County.

The first part of the event, the discussion, will be streamed online starting at 6:00 PM and can be followed on the Európa Pont Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/europapont).

 ### Egy nap, ha felNŐ – Fiatal nők lelki egészségéről

Title: A Day for Women's Mental Health: Egy nap, ha felNŐ

Event Description:
Join us on Tuesday, October 10th, 2023, at 4:00 PM UTC+02 in Budapest for "Egy nap, ha felNŐ – Fiatal nők lelki egészségéről" (A Day for Women's Mental Health). This event, organized by Mathias Corvinus Collegium - MCC, aims to delve into the topic of women's mental health and challenge the existing prejudices and stereotypes surrounding it.

Description:
October 10th is recognized globally as World Mental Health Day since 1992. Today, discussions about mental health often revolve around alarming statistics and desperate calls for attention, particularly when it comes to young people. While talking about mental health is no longer as stigmatizing as it used to be, there are still numerous prejudices that persist. However, World Mental Health Day also presents an opportunity to change our perspective on mental health.

For instance, are the approaches that differentiate the factors influencing the mental health of women and men accurate? Do adolescent girls face different challenges compared to young adult women? And what about the experiences of female leaders and mothers? These are some of the questions we will explore during our event on October 10th.

The event will feature several esteemed guests:

1. Hal Melinda - Clinical Psychologist, Economist, Research Leader at the Learning Research Institute
2. Hegyesi Zita - Communication and Mental Hygiene Specialist, Executive Member of the Pure Program
3. Pető Dorina - Social Psychologist, MCC, Deep Breath Project
4. Sárkány Fanni - Program Director of the Women's Public Leadership Training Program
5. Moderator: Kiss-Kozma Georgina - Researcher at the Institute for Youth Research
