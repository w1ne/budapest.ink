 ### Vogue Dawn @Központ

Vogue Dawn is making its grand return to Központ! Get ready for a night of fierce competition and incredible dance moves. But before we hit the dance floor, there will be a Mini Ball, where members of the Ballroom Community can showcase their talents and compete in various categories.

The event kicks off with a warm-up session from 9:00 PM to 9:30 PM. Then, it's time for the Mini Ball from 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM. Here, participants will compete in categories such as OTA Best Makeup, Nail Affaire, Hands Performance, OTA Realness (FemQueen, DragQueen, TransMan, BQ, DragKing), OTA Runway, Beginner Vogue, and OTA Performance (10s with only one element).

The esteemed judge for the Mini Ball will be announced soon, and the event will be hosted by the fabulous MC, Iulian Elle. Providing the beats for the night will be the talented DJs, Daniel Moritz from 10:30 PM to 12:30 AM, followed by Krebow from 12:30 AM to 2:00 AM.

For those who may be unfamiliar with what a (Vogue) Ball is, it originated in the underground black and Latin BIPOC Trans community in New York. It serves as a safe space where individuals can express themselves freely and compete in fashion and vogue dance. You may have seen elements of vogue dance in mainstream media, such as music videos by Madonna and FKA Twigs, or TV shows like "Pose" or "Legendary." Voguing is all about fashion, modeling, and striking awe-inspiring poses, sometimes requiring great flexibility.

During a Ball, the participants showcase their talents on a runway, with judges at the end and the audience on both sides, cheering them on. It's like a fashion show mixed with a dance competition, where participants battle it out in various categories, showcasing their dance skills, beauty, and fashion sense.

Tickets for Vogue Dawn are priced at 1500 HUF. It's important to note that there will be a zero-tolerance policy for any form of discrimination, including sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, ageism, ableism, and body shaming. The event aims to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone.

So mark your calendars for Friday, October 20, 2023, from 9:00 PM to 2:00 AM, and get ready to experience the magic of Vogue Dawn at Központ. It's a night you won't want to miss!
