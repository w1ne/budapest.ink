 ### The Politics of Happiness: The Role of Sociology in an Authoritarian State and World in Crisis

# The Politics of Happiness: The Role of Sociology in an Authoritarian State and World in Crisis

### Date and Time
#### Thursday, March 14, 2024 at 12:00 PM CET

Are you interested in diving deep into sociology's role in challenging authoritarianism and navigating a world in crisis? Join us for an insightful discussion at the ELTE Institute of Political and International Studies.

**Speaker:** Professor Andrew Ryder from the Institute of Political and International Studies (POLIR), ELTE, will be sharing his expertise.

**Discussant:** Dr. Eszter P√°l, Associate Professor in the Department of Social Theory at ELTE, will provide additional perspectives.

**Chair:** Leading the discussion will be Dr. Andr√°s Schweitzer, Associate Professor at POLIR.

**Venue:** Community Room 2.61 North Building, ELTE. Come and engage in this thought-provoking conversation.

In this event, the focus will be on Hungary as a case study. The paper will explore how sociology's development has faced obstacles due to conservative traditions, authoritarianism, and Marxist-Leninist influences. The discussion will delve into how sociologists have either aligned with established norms or bravely voiced dissent. It is argued that critical sociology plays a crucial role in acting as a societal check and balance, especially when facing reactive and illiberal forces. By channeling the spirit of public intellectuals, critical sociology aims to spark transformative actions and present utopian alternatives, ultimately shaping a new 'politics of happiness'.

To access the paper discussed in the event, kindly email ryder.andrew@tatk.elte.hu for a copy.

Get ready to explore the complex interplay between sociology, politics, and societal well-being. Save the date and join us for an enriching discussion on March 14th!
