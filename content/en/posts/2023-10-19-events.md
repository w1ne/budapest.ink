 ### BETELT! FULL! Milena Annaloro: The house of sacred memories | Performance

# BETELT! FULL! Milena Annaloro: The house of sacred memories | Performance

Are you curious about the link between objects, memories, and emotions? Do you believe that the history of an object determines its meaning? What secrets can an object hide? Does an anonymous, neutral object truly matter? These are just a few of the questions that Milena Annaloro's performance, "The house of sacred memories," aims to explore.

Inspired by the discovery of a "kit of ritual objects" belonging to a priestess from ancient Pompeii, this performance delves into the relationship between memories, feelings, and objects. Using archival objects that belong to Annaloro's own life and history, she creates a ritual of rewriting memory, both shared and individual. The ultimate goal of this performance is to provide participants with an intimate and transformative experience of deep, generative sharing.

This one-on-one performance is designed for only one participant at a time, ensuring a highly personalized and immersive experience. To participate, you must book your spot by sending an email to simonliliana05@gmail.com, including your name, surname, and preferred day and time slot. To secure your participation, please transfer the ticket price of 3000 Ft.

The performance will take place in Budapest's VII District, with the exact location details communicated via email following your registration.

Milena Annaloro, the creator, choreographer, and performer of this piece, is an artist originally from Turin, Italy, and currently based in Budapest, Hungary. With a background in painting and visual arts, Annaloro has shifted her focus to relational practices, exploring the possibilities of voice, performance, installation, and shared experiences. She is currently participating in the "Arts & Healing" masterclass program at the School of Disobedience in Budapest.

The performance is organized and supported by the School of Disobedience, with Simon Liliana serving as the assistant production manager. The objects used in the performance have been collected by Milena Annaloro, with the event hosted by Koleszár Adél.
