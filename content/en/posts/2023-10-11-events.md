 ### A Freeszfe Egyesület bemutatja: Az üvegbura

Freeszfe Association presents: The Bell Jar
 
Have you ever experienced a time when you couldn't find the words to tell your story? When eating, sleeping, and even reading became a challenge? This is the essence of "The Bell Jar," a performance brought to you by Freeszfe Association in collaboration with Trafó House.

"The Bell Jar" tackles various themes, ranging from femininity and peculiar parties to unattainable men and wealthy female writers. However, at its core, the play delves into the dark and taboo subject of suicide, a desire that continues to haunt individuals from all walks of life. Even those who seemingly live privileged lives - the perceptive, well-fed, young, and talented, like Esther Greenwood.

Drawing inspiration from Sylvia Plath's cult novel, "The Bell Jar" is an incredibly precise representation of alienation. It confronts the struggles of feeling disconnected and estranged from oneself and society.

Unfortunately, we currently do not have specific details regarding the date, time, and location of the event. However, you can stay updated by visiting the Trafó House website at [trafo.hu/programok/szinhaz_freeszfe_egyesulet_az_uvegbura](trafo.hu/programok/szinhaz_freeszfe_egyesulet_az_uvegbura).

Keep an eye out for this thought-provoking performance that will challenge your perspective and shed light on the complexities of the human experience.

 ### Az eltűnt hívek nyomában

**Event Announcement: Az eltűnt hívek nyomában**

Are you interested in the recent statistics related to religious communities in Hungary? Have you ever wondered about the reasons behind the decline in the number of churchgoers in the country? If so, then the upcoming event "Az eltűnt hívek nyomában" (In Search of the Disappeared Believers) is for you.

Recently, the data from the 2022 census regarding religious communities was made public, causing shock and concern. For the first time, the followers of churches in Hungary have become a minority. The most significant decline is observed among members of the Roman Catholic Church, but there is also a noticeable decrease in the other so-called historical churches. Additionally, the proportion of those who choose not to answer questions regarding their religious affiliation is surprisingly high. All of this raises several questions and invites numerous interpretations.

Does this trend in Hungary align with the international pattern? What characteristics can be considered unique or common among different churches and denominations? What sociological, religious-historical, socio-psychological, and (ecclesiastical) political reasons can account for this situation in 2022? What hypotheses can be drawn from the available data?

Join the roundtable discussion with experts to find answers to these questions and more. The participants will include religious sociologists, philosophy of religion experts, sociologists, theologians, and legal scholars. They will delve into the various aspects surrounding the decline of believers and provide their insights.

Date, time, and location details:

- Date and Time: To be announced.
- Location: Országos Rabbiképző – Zsidó Egyetem (Hungarian Jewish University), Budapest.
- Address: VIII. Scheiber Sándor utca 2.

Don't miss this opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the current religious landscape in Hungary and the factors influencing the decline of believers. Join us for an engaging and thought-provoking discussion at "Az eltűnt hívek nyomában"!

For more information about the event, visit the official website of Országos Rabbiképző - Zsidó Egyetem.
