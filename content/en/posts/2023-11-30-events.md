 ### IM Paul Mouginot: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS AS NARRATIVE PERCOLATORS //LECTURE

Title: IM Paul Mouginot: Artificial Intelligence Tools as Narrative Percolators - Lecture

Are you curious about the intersection of artificial intelligence and art? Join us for an engaging lecture by IM Paul Mouginot as he explores the topic of "Artificial Intelligence Tools as Narrative Percolators: History and Applications in Art." This thought-provoking presentation will delve into the ways in which AI algorithms and mathematical processing can be utilized as tools to create new forms of art.

Aurèce Vettier, an art project founded by Paul Mouginot in 2019, serves as an embodiment of the collaborative, open, and hybrid approach to art. This project employs AI algorithms and heavy mathematical processing in a virtual space to develop new forms, which are then translated into tangible objects through various crafts. Rather than viewing machine-generated elements as finished works, the approach adopted by Aurèce Vettier considers them as raw materials that expand conceptual possibilities and complement the existing knowledge of art history.

The lecture will take place on Thursday, November 30, 2023, at 9:00 AM UTC+01. The venue for this event is the MKE Intermedia Department, Large Lecture Room, located at Kmety György utca 27. The host of the lecture is the Intermedia Department of the Hungarian University of Fine Arts (HUFA). The language of the lecture will be English.

Do not miss this opportunity to gain insights into the fascinating world of art and artificial intelligence. Join us as IM Paul Mouginot explores the history and applications of AI tools as narrative percolators in art. Expand your artistic horizons and discover new possibilities in this rapidly evolving field.

For more information about Aurèce Vettier, visit their website at [aurecevettier.com](https://www.aurecevettier.com).

We look forward to seeing you at this enlightening lecture!
