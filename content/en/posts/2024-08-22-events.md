# Deep Dives: The Progress Paradox - Are We Happier Yet?

Are you ready to dive deep into thought-provoking discussions on society, culture, politics, and psychology? If so, mark your calendar for Thursday, August 22, 2024, from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM CEST for an engaging event hosted by Deep Dives Budapest.

Join us for an exploration of "The Progress Paradox" at the upcoming meeting. We will delve into the hidden costs of modern life and consider the impact of civilization on our overall well-being. Have our technological advancements and societal norms truly brought us happiness, or have they distanced us from our natural instincts and deeper fulfillment?

This event aims to challenge your assumptions about progress and prompt you to contemplate alternative ways of living that are more aligned with our human nature. Engage in a lively conversation that pushes the boundaries of what it means to be "civilized."

The event will take place at Ant Collective, located at 1133 Budapest, Tisza utca 11, near the Dózsa György út metro station. The contribution fee is HUF 2000, and light refreshments, tea, and water will be provided at the venue.

Meet your hosts, Barbara and Viktoria, who bring their unique perspectives to the discussion. Barbara is a self-proclaimed wannabe hippie and anti-capitalist, constantly pondering societal issues in search of a utopia for everyone. On the other hand, Viktoria is a serene and passionate adventurer, unattached to societal norms and always exploring new hobbies.

Don't miss this opportunity to challenge your beliefs, gain fresh perspectives, and connect with like-minded individuals. Come ready to discuss, debate, and most importantly, stay curious about "The Progress Paradox - Are We Happier Yet?"

See you there! 😊
