 ### Szikora Róbert – Lezsák Sándor: Az ÉG tartja a FÖLDET musical

Mark your calendars for an extraordinary musical experience on September 1, 2023! The Margitszigeti Színház, in collaboration with the Kecskeméti Katona József Nemzeti Színház, is proud to present "Szikora Róbert – Lezsák Sándor: Az ÉG tartja a FÖLDET" musical.

Based on the novel "Erzsébet, a szerelem szentje" by Zsuffa Tünde, this musical brings to life the story of Árpád-házi Szent Erzsébet, the most famous Hungarian saint. The musical's creators, Lezsák Sándor (script and lyrics), Szikora Robert (composer), Zsuffa Tünde (author), and Cseke Péter (director and artistic director of Kecskeméti Katona József Nemzeti Színház), have taken on the ambitious task of bringing this historical figure to the stage.

Árpád-házi Szent Erzsébet, who is known as Elizabeth of Hungary in the world, was torn apart from her family - her father II. András and her mother Merániai Gertrúd - at the age of four due to power interests. However, her tragic life in a cold Thuringian court did not harden her heart in a foreign land. Growing up as a German princess, she is widely recognized as Thüringia Elizabeth, with no apparent connection to Hungary. The goal of the creative team behind this musical was to highlight the values of Christianity and Hungarian historical past and rediscover and elevate this well-known saint in Hungary, who became a protector of the poor and the sick. 

Elizabeth is not just a medieval saint depicted in altars, but a real-life woman whose beliefs, open-mindedness, modern thinking, love for her husband, adoration for her children, sincere and painful grief in widowhood, and unwavering faith inspired the creators to prove that she was a flesh-and-blood person who could always hold her ground in any era.

The message of Elizabeth's life journey resonates with people of today as well – not tolerating falsehood and injustice, helping the needy, practicing active love even during epidemics, natural disasters, and famine. The musical not only brings forth moral values but also allows the audience to explore the era of knights and crusades, while unveiling the legendary portrait of Elizabeth amidst the intricacies of power struggles, murders, and the hardship of rebuilding the country devastated by the Mongol invasion. Her faith and encouraging words empower her brother, the future King Béla IV, in the reconstruction of the country.

With an amazing cast including Szikora Róbert, Lezsák Sándor, and Zsuffa Tünde, this musical promises to be a captivating experience. BORI RÉKA will portray the role of Erzsébet, known as Elizabeth in the English-speaking world, and she will be joined by talented actors and actresses such as KOLTAI-NAGY BALÁZS, BUCH TIBOR, SZEKERES ADRIEN, SZEREDNYEY BÉLA, SZABÓ P. SZILVESZTER, VARGA MIKLÓS, MÄRCZ FRUZSINA, SIPOS IMRE, SZEGVÁRI JÚLIA, HAJDÚ MELINDA, KOVÁCS GYOPÁR, ORTH PÉTER, VARGA-HUSZTI MÁTÉ, ARADI IMRE, MECHLE CHRISTIAN, LAKATOS MÁTÉ, PÁL ATTILA, KÖRTVÉLYESSY ZSOLT, and many more.

Don't miss out on this magnificent musical event that aims to bring history and Hungarian culture to life on the stage. Join us on September 1, 2023, at 8:00 PM UTC+02 at the Margitszigeti Szabadtéri Színpad for an unforgettable evening of music, storytelling, and celebration of an inspiring figure. In case of rain, the event will be held on September 3. Get ready to be captivated by the incredible performances and immerse yourself in the world of Árpád-házi Szent Erzsébet, a true embodiment of courage, love, and faith. Book your tickets now!
