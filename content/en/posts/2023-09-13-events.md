 ### AntiBME napok 2023

Dear friends of ELTE,

With the start of the new semester, it is once again time for the traditional free-spirited celebration, the AntiBME. But what exactly is this?

Well, let me remind you of how the organizers perfectly summed it up four years ago...

"You see, this is the time when we usually organize the BME Days, and the sound insulation is usually solved by hanging soundproof garbage bags on the barriers, thus muffling the sound of the outdoor concert.

In other words, we gather at our own university, listen to great music for free, enjoy some alcoholic beverages, and in some places, the glow of a water pipe's charcoal adds to the ambiance.

We welcome everyone with open arms and it's completely free!
The Unofficial Organizing Squad by Chance"

So mark your calendars for the AntiBME days from September 12th at 6:00 PM to September 15th at 2:00 AM, and join us at Pázmány Péter walkway 1/A in Budapest for this unforgettable event. The organizer, Dávid Hegedűs, has put together an incredible lineup of musicians and artists to entertain you throughout the night.

This is your chance to experience the vibrant spirit of ELTE and celebrate the start of the new semester. Don't miss out on this opportunity to make new memories and enjoy an evening of free music, good company, and a lively atmosphere.

Whether you're a current student, alumni, or simply a music enthusiast, the AntiBME days are open to everyone. So gather your friends, get ready to dance, and let the music take you on a journey.

We look forward to seeing you there!

(Note: This event will be held in Budapest, Hungary, and the timing mentioned is in local time.)
