The opening event will commence with a special message and speech from Comrade Stalin, read by Ádám Kovács, the First Young Stakhanovist of the Havanna Housing Estate. Following the message, Gábor Gulyás, an esteemed art connoisseur, will inaugurate the exhibition. The event will then continue with a groundbreaking performance by the Scientists and Fool's Disco, promoting capitalist popularity on Pioneer Day.

To attend the opening, guests are expected to dress in attire costing over three million euros, carrying frozen donperignon champagne in hand. Upon arrival, a ten million euro supporting check is to be submitted to support the Super Intragalactic Top International Charitable Snob-Weapon-Supporting Humanitarian Event of the Art Totality and Ultimate Snobification Movement.

The exhibition will be open to the public free of charge until October 4. Don't miss this opportunity to experience the overwhelming power and creative genius of the Dadaist movement brought to life by drMáriás.

 ### Bike Maffia kávézó nyitóbuli

Join us for the grand opening of the Bike Maffia café on Friday, September 15, 2023, at 4:00 PM UTC+02. Located at 47.483543, 19.072652, this café is not just any ordinary café, but your future hangout spot. It is a community space, a coffee and hot chocolate bar, and a bar with a very unique concept, in true "Bikemaffia-style".

When you eat or drink in the "Másik Szoba" (The Other Room), you are not only satisfying your cravings but also making a donation. After your consumption, you will see the amount you have donated on the café's display as well as on our Facebook/Instagram page. It's a great way to track your contribution!

But let's get to the main event. On September 15th, we will celebrate the official opening of the "Másik Szoba", and we warmly invite you to join us from 4:00 PM onwards. On this day and the following week, we will be collecting funds for the Pediatric Clinic's branch on Tűzoltó Street. The funds will be used to create direction signs for the building, making it easier for the young patients and their parents to navigate within the hospital. So, every drink and food item you consume in the "Másik Szoba" during this week will contribute to this cause.

The opening event will be relaxed, with no strict protocol. We'll chat, fist bump, and enjoy a good pilsner, coffee, or hot chocolate. At 4:30 PM, we'll have a conversation with Tóth Imre, the owner of Élesztő, and Havasi Zoli, the leader of Bike Maffia, about how the for-profit market, hospitality, and nonprofit organizations can come together, support each other's work, and create value in the past and in the future. The conversation will be moderated by Azurák Csaba.

After the chat, around 5:30 PM, we'll have an interactive session discussing the story of Bike Maffia. You'll have the chance to ask questions and engage with us in a casual and fun manner. From 6:00 PM onwards, we want to hear your opinion! You can taste our hot chocolate selection for free, but in return, we ask that you give us your feedback on the flavors.

Let's spend some quality time together, sipping cocktails and enjoying a few happy hours between 4:00 PM and 7:00 PM. During this time, if you buy a premium cocktail, we'll give you two. Sounds like a good deal, right?

We are still adding more surprises to the program, so it's worth keeping an eye on us. But the most important thing is to mark September 15th on your calendar. Be there at the Bike Maffia café and let's make it a memorable day!
