 ### N√∂v√©nycsere √©s -√∂r√∂kbefogad√°s a Hunyadin

Join the plant exchange and adoption event at Hunyadi Square!

Are you a responsible plant lover? Do you want to make your indoor jungle or balcony garden more sustainable? Then join us for the plant exchange and adoption event at Hunyadi Square!

Since 2018, we have been organizing plant exchanges to help make your living spaces truly green and cost-effective. The plant business can sometimes be unfriendly to the environment, and if you've had bad experiences and feel like a plant destroyer, it's not your fault. The green industry is still an industry, and an expensive one at that! That's why the Z√∂ld√≠t≈ëk community was created.

With our community, we aim to help promote responsible plant care and make nature accessible to urban dwellers like you. So come and join us!

This event is perfect for you if:
- You want to make friends with like-minded plant enthusiasts.
- You've raised too many seedlings and want to exchange them with other balcony gardeners.
- You've propagated your houseplants and have extra baby plants.
- Your cacti have multiplied, your pilea babies have outgrown their pots, or you simply need some comfort plants because you can't afford to spend on new ones.

To ensure a cheerful atmosphere, we have a few rules:
- No money should be exchanged for plants.
- Only plants should be exchanged, not items unrelated to plant care or balcony gardening.
- If you have a pest-infested or sick plant, it should be kept separate and labeled accordingly for possible salvation.
- Please do not leave your plants unattended as we cannot accommodate leftover plants.
- Do not bring treated seeds or chemically treated crops.
- It is not ethical to resell or trade plants received as gifts.

Even if you don't have any plants to offer at the moment, you can still register and join us for the plant exchange. Visit www.zolditok.hu/novenycsere to register or email us at info@zolditok.hu to sign up.

The plant exchange and meeting place will be at Hunyadi Square, next to the L√≠ra bookstore. If the weather tries to spoil our plans, we will notify registered participants about the alternative plan.

In addition to the plant exchange, we have a range of green activities from 10 AM to 2 PM. You can participate in a contemplation contest, play green quizzes, and connect with nature as an urban resident.

We look forward to welcoming you to the friendliest community in the city!

Please note that this event is part of the Z√∂ld√ºl≈ë Ter√©zv√°ros program, financed by Ter√©zv√°ros municipality. Photos and videos may be taken during the event.

The event is free and pet- and child-friendly. Please note that pets are not allowed in the market or park areas, but they are allowed at the event location.
