If you're a dog lover looking for a day filled with fun and furry cuddles, then mark your calendars for the upcoming Dog Walking event organized by Erasmus Student Network (ESN) Corvinus. The event is set to take place on September 11th and 13th at Etele t√©r 5-7 in Budapest, Hungary.

The meeting point for this heartwarming experience is Kelenf√∂ld Railway Station at 7:45 am on both Wednesday and Friday. After a short train ride to T√°rnok, you'll have the opportunity to walk and spend quality time with the adorable pups from T√°rnok's shelter "Eb√°rvah√°z."

To show your support for these furry friends, there is a suggested donation of 700 HUF or 1000 HUF. Every contribution, big or small, goes a long way in helping these lovable dogs. Don't forget to wear your "play" clothes as things might get a little muddy during the walk!

The entirety of the ticket proceeds will be donated to the dog shelter, but if you wish to contribute more, there are several items that the shelter is in need of. These include canned dog food with high meat content, hypoallergenic dry food, fruits and vegetables for raw feeding, pet vitamins, collars for 10-20kg dogs, cleaning supplies like liquid soap and paper towels, and more.

By participating in this event, not only will you get to spend time with some adorable dogs, but you'll also be making a positive impact and showing your social responsibility towards animal welfare. So come along, join the cause, and spread some love to our four-legged friends in need!
