 ### Wes Anderson: A Francia Kiadás / The French Dispatch 

Join us for a special screening of Wes Anderson's latest film, "The French Dispatch," at Bem Mozi in Budapest. The event will take place on Monday, July 31, 2023, from 9:00 PM to 10:45 PM UTC+02. 

"The French Dispatch" is a colorful and captivating American-German film directed by Wes Anderson. The movie stars an incredible ensemble cast including Timothée Chalamet, Benicio Del Toro, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Edward Norton, Christoph Waltz, Léa Seydoux, Jeffrey Wright, Elisabeth Moss, Willem Dafoe, and Anjelica Huston. Please note that the film is not recommended for children under 12 years old.

The story revolves around the editor-in-chief of a widely distributed French magazine, Arthur Howitzer, Jr., who passes away. In his memory, the editorial team gathers to write his obituary. Through their recollections, four stories come to life: a travelogue from the Bicycle Reporter in the city's notorious neighborhoods, "The Concrete Masterpiece" about a psychopathic painter-criminal and the woman guarding him, who happens to be his muse, as well as persistent art dealers; "The Manifesto Modifications," a chronicle of a student uprising, love and death in the shadows of barricades; and "The Police Captain's Private Dining Room," a tension-filled narrative about drugs, child abduction, and the art of dining.

The screening of "The French Dispatch" is part of the "BEST OF WES" film series, and it will be shown in its original language with Hungarian subtitles. You can purchase tickets for 1,600 Ft either at the venue between 5:00 PM and 9:00 PM every day, online at cooltix.hu/b/bemmozi, or reserve your tickets at https://form.jotform.com/231958404339361.
