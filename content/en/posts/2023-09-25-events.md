Attention all seekers of peace and spiritual connection! Mark your calendars for an incredible event happening in Budapest. On Monday, September 25, 2023, from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM UTC+02, the Cor et Lumen Christi Magyarország organization is hosting an event called "Tűz és Fény - dicsőítő szentségimádás - Találkozás az élő Jézussal" (Fire and Light - Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament - Meeting with the Living Jesus).

Imagine an evening filled with the soothing warmth of a flickering fire and the radiant glow of heavenly light. This event offers a unique opportunity to experience the presence and worship of Jesus in a deeply profound and immersive way. Whether you are seeking peace, solace, or simply the joy of communal prayer, the "Tűz és Fény" event aims to provide all that and more.

This gathering will take place at Bartok Béla út 149 in Budapest, where the atmosphere will be set by the Cor et Lumen Christi Magyarország team. Their dedication to creating a truly spiritual environment ensures that you will feel a sense of tranquility and connection throughout the event.

The music for the evening will be provided by the esteemed Te Deum Zenekar, known for their uplifting and soul-stirring melodies. Their music will serve as the backdrop to your spiritual journey, elevating your experience and drawing you closer to the divine.

No matter where you are on your spiritual journey, this event is open to all who seek the love, power, and gentleness of God.

As a young priest, I can personally attest to the transformative power of these adoration events. They have brought me peace, liberation, and a sense of unity through shared prayer. Even in moments when I struggle to see the beauty of the Church, these worship experiences never fail to leave me in awe.

Let us remember the words of 2 Timothy 1:7: "For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love, and self-discipline." Indeed, God is good, mighty, majestic, merciful, awe-inspiring, and wonderful. He is calling and waiting for you. Join us and meet Jesus in a way you've never imagined.

Don't miss this extraordinary opportunity to connect with the divine and rediscover the joy of worship. Make your way to Bartok Béla út 149 in Budapest on September 25, 2023, and experience the transformative power of "Tűz és Fény - dicsőítő szentségimádás - Találkozás az élő Jézussal."

 ### A társadalmi mobilitás ára könyvbemutató

**Book Launch Event: "The Cost of Social Mobility"**

Join us for the book launch of "The Cost of Social Mobility: Consequences for First-Generation Graduates and Class Transition" edited by Judit Durst, Zsanna Nyírő, and Ábel Bereményi. The event will be held on Monday, September 25, 2023, at 6:00 PM UTC+02 at Három Holló (Színházterem) in Budapest, Hungary.

"The Cost of Social Mobility" explores the experiences of first-generation graduates and the consequences of social mobility. The book delves into the challenges faced by individuals who have moved from rural areas to cities, acquired a university education, and gone through class transition. It highlights how personal achievements are often accompanied by collective setbacks and the harsh reality of social mobility.

The book not only examines the narrowing opportunities for social mobility through education in Hungary but also sheds light on the high price paid by individuals who have achieved upward mobility compared to their parents. It explores the intersecting factors of class status, minority status (often stigmatized), and gender to understand how they shape an individual's life opportunities, including their occupational position and intimate relationships. The book also focuses on the higher mobility costs typically faced by racialized minority groups, such as the Roma.

"The Cost of Social Mobility" is the result of a four-year research project that involved interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers from different class, gender, and ethnic backgrounds. The book incorporates insights from nearly two hundred interviewees who shared their own mobility stories, offering a glimpse into their sometimes tumultuous life journeys marked by poverty and marginalized minority status trauma.

The event will begin with a performance by the Independent Theater, followed by presentations about the book by Luca Kristóf (TK Social Research Institute), Mária Neményi (TK Social Research Institute), Krisztina Németh (KRTK Regional Research Institute), János Orsós and Tibor Derdák (Dr. Ámbédkar School), and Fanni Puskás (KRTK Regional Research Institute). This will be followed by a panel discussion featuring the editors and authors of the book, and a Q&A session with the audience. The moderator for the event will be Attila Szabó from Qubit.

We warmly invite anyone interested to attend this book launch event and engage in meaningful discussions about the cost of social mobility and its implications for individuals and society. Don't miss this opportunity to gain insights from this important research.

For more information about the book, please visit the publisher's website: [A társadalmi mobilitás ára könyvének információ oldala](https://gondolatkiado.hu/.../a-tarsadalmi-mobilitas-ara.../\)

We look forward to seeing you on September 25th!

The Calvary Chapel played a central role in this movement, which ultimately laid the foundation for the Golgota churches in present-day Hungary. The film features Kelsey Grammer, known for his roles as a Christian actor, portraying the pastor Chuck Smith, Jonathan Roumie, who previously played Jesus in the series "The Chosen," and other well-known actors. 

The film will be shown in its original language, English, with Hungarian subtitles. The doors will open at 5:30 PM, and the screening will start at 6:00 PM. Please note that admission is free, but seating is limited to 280 people.

Come and experience the Jesus Revolution with us at @volt Híradó Mozi.
