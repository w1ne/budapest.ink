 ### Idan Abolnik Multiple Attacker Seminar Budapest!

Hello!

If you're interested in learning from someone with real-life experience in surviving wars and protecting high-ranking individuals, then you don't want to miss the Idan Abolnik Multiple Attacker Seminar in Budapest!

Idan Abolnik is the creator of the Kalah System and has served in one of Israel's most respected military units, the Golani Brigade. This unit is constantly on the front lines, involved in combat operations. Idan has participated in numerous high-risk missions in Lebanon, the West Bank, and Cisjordania, including terrorist arrests and tactical maneuvers in hostile territories.

After his time with Golani, Idan continued his career with Israeli security forces, where he was responsible for personal protection, transportation between Arab and Jewish cities, and securing maritime shipments. In 2003, he moved to Johannesburg, South Africa, where he founded Golani Security and developed the Kalah System based on his own experiences.

In South Africa, Idan trained rural farmers to defend themselves against daily brutal robberies and murders, earning recognition for the Kalah System due to the incredible attacks his students survived.

Now, Idan will be visiting Budapest at the end of October to conduct a 2-day seminar focused on multiple attack situations. The topics covered will include attackers starting with bare hands and progressing to knives, guns, machetes/sticks, or a combination of these. Ground combat situations and scenarios involving knives, guns, and sticks will also be covered.

It's important to note that the seminars are intense, both physically and mentally. Idan is not coming to win our hearts, but to ruthlessly make the most of the time he spends with us and share his knowledge.

One of Idan's students, Chris Herbs, survived a multiple attack situation where he was attacked in his home by two people in the middle of the night. Chris was able to survive thanks to divine intervention and his preparedness, but he lost 2 liters of blood in the process. This case highlights the importance of being prepared for such situations.

If you feel up to the challenge, you can sign up for the seminar by emailing tibor.kincses@mrsd.hu. We kindly ask all applicants to pay the seminar fee as soon as possible, but no later than October 6th, as space is limited.

The seminar will take place on October 21-22, 2023, starting at 10:00 AM. The duration of the seminar is usually between 4-6 hours, so be prepared for that. The fee for the 2-day seminar is 120 Euros.

Please note that the location may change depending on the number of participants, but the current address is 1091 Budapest Üllői út 47.

For payment, you can transfer the fee to the bank account of Kádár Viktor Gyula at OTP Bank. The account details are as follows:
- Name: Kádár Viktor Gyula
- Bank: OTP
- IBAN NUMBER: HU711177307800544414
- BIC/SWIFT OTPVHUHB
- Address of Bank: Hungary, 1051 Budapest Nádor utca 16.

We hope to see you at the seminar and learn from Idan Abolnik's expertise in multiple attack situations!

Respectfully,
The Organizers,
Tibor Kincses
Viktor Kádár
