 ### Vogue Dawn @Központ

Vogue Dawn is back in Központ! Get ready to dance and immerse yourself in the vibrant atmosphere of the Vogue community. But before the dancing begins, there will be a Mini Ball, where members of the Ballroom Community can compete with each other in various categories.

The event kicks off with a warm-up from 21:00-21:30, followed by the Mini Ball from 21:30-22:30. Expect an evening filled with fierce competition and incredible talent. The exact judges for the Mini Ball are to be announced, but the Master of Ceremonies will be Iulian Elle. DJing for the night is Hungarian Father Daniel Elle, also known as Daniel Moritz.

The Mini Ball will feature several categories for participants to showcase their skills. From the OTA Best Make Up, Nail Affaire, and Hands Performance categories, to OTA Realness (including FemQueen, DragQueen, TransMan, BQ, DragKing), OTA Runway, Beginner Vogue, and OTA Performance (with 10s and only one element), there will be a range of opportunities for everyone to shine.

If you're unfamiliar with what a Vogue Ball is, it originated as an event in the underground black and Latin BIPOC Trans community in New York. It's a space where individuals can express themselves freely and be whoever they want to be. It combines fashion and vogue dance, which you may have seen in mainstream media through music artists like Madonna and FKA Twigs, as well as TV series like Pose or Legendary.

Voguing is all about fashion, modeling, and striking poses, sometimes requiring great flexibility. The Ball is akin to a fashion show, with a runway in the center and judges at the end. The audience on both sides cheers for the competitors as they battle it out on the runway in various dancing, beauty, and fashion categories.

Tickets for the event are priced at 1500 HUF. But remember, the event has a strict policy against any form of discrimination, including sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, ageism, ableism, and body shaming. It aims to create an inclusive and safe space for everyone to enjoy the night.

Don't miss out on this exciting event! Come and experience the vibrant energy of Vogue Dawn at Központ. Get ready to showcase your skills or simply enjoy the incredible performances. It's going to be a night to remember!
