 ### HIKE to the CASTLE of DRÉGELY- DAY TRIP from BUDAPEST

Hello Hikers!

Are you ready for an exciting day trip from Budapest? Join us on a hike to the Castle of Drégely and explore the beautiful Börzsöny mountains. Fall is the perfect time for hiking in Central Europe, with cool weather and colorful leaves creating a peaceful ambiance in the forests.

The Börzsöny mountains are the highest and northernmost range near Budapest, filled with a rich history of miners, monks, and knights. On our hike, we will visit two legendary castle ruins - Drégely and Kámor. Drégely Castle was the site of an epic siege during the Ottoman wars in 1552, while Kámor offers a spectacular viewpoint with ancient legends surrounding its abandoned fortifications and mysterious tunnels.

The hike will cover a distance of 15 km with a 600-meter ascent and descent, taking around 5 hours to complete. Don't worry, this hike is suitable for everyone, but make sure to wear proper trekking shoes. Along the way, we'll have the opportunity to admire the autumn-colored beech, hornbeam, and oak tree forests, and learn about the unique geology and vegetation of Northern Hungary.

After the hike, we'll end in the village of Diósjenő, where we can enjoy some drinks and snacks before catching the train back to Budapest. You have the option to purchase a ticket with lunch for 5900 Ft, which includes a traditional Hungarian dish of bean goulash with meat, or a ticket without lunch for 4900 Ft. Don't forget to get your tickets at the link provided.

Here is a schedule of the day:
9:00 - Meeting at Nyugati railway station, platform number 5 (address: Nyugati tér).
10:56 - Arrival at Sáferkút railway station (after a quick change in Vác).
12:00 - Ascending to the castle of Drégely.
14:30 - Reaching the summit of Kámor.
17:00 - Descending to the village of Diósjenő for food, drinks, and rest.
19:30 - Taking the train from Diósjenő to Budapest (change in Vác).
21:00 - Arrival back to Budapest-Nyugati.

There are plenty of reasons why you should join this hike. Not only will you have the opportunity to visit one of the most romantic castle ruins in the country and experience extraordinary mountain viewpoints that are highly Instagrammable, but you'll also have the chance to hike through stunning autumn forests and learn about the unique geography and plant life of Northern Hungary. Plus, you'll get to spend the day with like-minded international hikers, making it a truly enjoyable experience.

Feel free to invite your friends and make it a group adventure. The more, the merrier! We can't wait to hike with you.

See you on the trails,
The Budapest Hikers and BAIS team

 ### WHOMAN1TY: Exhibition by Nusi Csejtei (Örvendek)

WHOMAN1TY: Exhibition by Nusi Csejtei (Örvendek)

We are thrilled to announce the upcoming exhibition, WHOMAN1TY, by Nusi Csejtei (Örvendek), hosted by Hintaló Iszoda in Budapest. The exhibition will take place at Bacsó Béla utca 15 and will run from the 5th of November to the 9th of December. The opening night will be on the 5th of November at 7 pm, and we invite you to join us for an evening filled with art and creativity.

WHOMAN1TY explores the power of creation and recreation in our material world from various perspectives. One aspect of the exhibition is a celebration of feminine attributes that women can be proud of, regardless of societal roles. It acknowledges the power of recreation and motherhood, which can bring both joy and challenges.

The exhibition also delves into the idea that creative power is not limited to a specific gender. It highlights that creativity is present in all genders, with a drop of consciousness. It emphasizes that it is not just the idea itself, but also the act of transforming the environment and bringing ideas into concrete reality.

Lastly, WHOMAN1TY pays homage to the beauty of geometry and the communication Mother Nature has with humanity. It appreciates the universal principles, specifically the Principle of Gender, and how it is represented in our everyday lives through both artificial and natural aspects.

It's important to note that this exhibition is not a feminist or political project. It aims to explore a universal principle and its manifestation in our lives. WHOMAN1TY encourages us to reflect on the power of creation, gender dynamics, and the beauty of our environment.

If you're interested in learning more about the artist, Nusi Csejtei (Örvendek), you can visit their website at [https://www.orvendek.com/](https://www.orvendek.com/), their Facebook profile at [https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61550693103038](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61550693103038), or their Instagram page at [https://www.instagram.com/orvendek/](https://www.instagram.com/orvendek/).
