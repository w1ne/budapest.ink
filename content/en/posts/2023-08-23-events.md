 ### PLATON KARATAEV-KONCERT

PLATON KARATAEV CONCERT - A Journey Through Paradoxes and Questions

Get ready for an eclectic musical experience as Platon Karataev takes the stage on Wednesday, August 23, 2023, at 7:30 PM UTC+02. This Hungarian indie quartet, named after the character from Lev Tolstoy's works, will be performing at the Klebelsberg Kult√∫rk√∫ria in Budapest, specifically at 1028 Budapest, Templom u. 2-10.

Formed in 2016, Platon Karataev explores the very essence of existence through their music, traversing paradoxes and seeking answers. Their music oscillates from atomic observations to celestial perspectives, weaving a tapestry of thought-provoking melodies and lyrics.

This concert is part of the XXV Pesthidegk√∫ti M≈±v√©szeti Fesztiv√°l, an annual event that celebrates art and brings together talented performers from various genres. As a special treat for this jubilee edition, the first 50 attendees will have the opportunity to purchase their tickets at half price, for only 2,000 Ft!

After gaining instant success with their acoustic-infused album "For Her's" in 2017, the band took a progressive turn with their more instrumentally complex album "Atoms" in 2020. With a focus on speaking in the most universal yet deeply personal way possible, "Atoms" encompasses elements of catharsis. Platon Karataev's newest album, "Part√©rt ki√°lt√≥," delves even deeper into the collective subconscious, taking listeners on a voyage of introspection and discovery.

Platon Karataev has garnered attention not just locally, but also on an international scale over the past four years. With over 5 million streams on Spotify, their music has reached audiences primarily in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany. The band has also had the privilege of performing at renowned festivals such as Sziget, Reeperbahn, Zandari Festa Seoul, Moscow Music Week, and Liverpool Sound City, in addition to three successful tours in Germany.

Don't miss out on this extraordinary evening with Platon Karataev at the Klebelsberg Kult√∫rk√∫ria. Immerse yourself in their unique blend of indie music and let their thought-provoking lyrics take you on a journey through the depths of the human experience. Get your tickets now and be part of a truly remarkable musical event!
