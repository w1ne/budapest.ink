 ### Flow 1. szülinapi boulder jam

Let's celebrate Flow's first birthday with an informal boulder jam! Whether you're a beginner climber or a seasoned pro, you're invited to join us on October 14th for a fun-filled day of conquering boulders. Afterward, we'll continue the celebration with a birthday party that will go on until the early hours of October 15th.

The event will feature a boulder jam competition, where participants will write and evaluate their own climbs based on the rules set by the Hungarian Climbing Federation (MHSSZ). The final results will be determined by the number of tops, zones, attempts, and flash climbs. There will be two categories: Professional (male/female) and Amateur (male/female). 

For those participating in the amateur category, please note that this is for climbers who have not climbed a 7A/7a difficulty boulder or sport climbing route in the past 2 years. In the gym, this means being able to climb green routes but struggling with red routes. If you have previously placed on the podium in an amateur competition, we kindly ask you to compete in the professional category to give others a chance.

There will be 30-35 boulder problems available to climbers, depending on their category. Participants will have 1 hour and 55 minutes to complete the climbs. We will divide climbers into groups of 30, with a 5-minute technical break between groups. The rest of the climbing gym will be open for use with a competition pass, except for the comp wall. Non-competitors can enjoy uninterrupted climbing in other areas.

To register for the competition, there is a uniform entry fee of 4000 Ft, which includes participation in the event and a starter pack. You can sign up using the following link: [registration link]. By registering, you agree to abide by the gym's rules, assume responsibility for your own safety, and comply with our privacy policy and competition regulations. The registration fee can be paid in advance at the reception desk, either by card or in cash. Please settle the fee no later than October 10th, as unpaid spots will be given to those on the waiting list starting from October 11th.

If the weather permits, we will also have a barbecue on the terrace for everyone to enjoy.

Here is the tentative schedule for the event on Saturday:

 ### BETELT! A feminizmus nyomában a fővárosban – Városi séta a Közélet Iskolájával

**BETELT! Tracing Feminism in the Capital - Urban Walk with Közélet Iskolája**

Join us for a fascinating urban walk in Budapest as we trace the footsteps of feminism in the early 20th century. The Hungarian feminist movement had a significant impact on the social and associative life of the time. In 1904, Glücklich Vilma and Schwimmer Rózsa, who emerged from the activities of previous women's associations, founded the Feminist Association in Budapest. The association established a network of branches in the countryside, published a journal, and had a nationwide influence on contemporary public life.

The feminist movement in Budapest organized several mass protests and submitted petitions to members of parliament advocating for universal suffrage. In addition to their offices (which also housed the editorial office of their journal) and library, they opened a Career Guidance Center and participated in various significant social work initiatives. During World War I, they supported widowed women and children, provided employment in vacant school buildings, and organized daycare services for them.

During this urban walk, we will retrace the diverse activities and ideology of the feminists. We will visit the locations of the association's founding meeting, public meetings, and other events. We will also explore the venue of a major international suffragette congress, the 1913 International Woman Suffrage Alliance, which took place in Budapest.

**Date and Time:** Saturday, October 14, 2023, from 15:00 to 17:00 (exact meeting point will be notified via email to registered participants)

If you would like to participate, please fill out the registration form by October 10th: [Registration Form](https://forms.gle/5SpTtymRazLoAkhp7)

The walk will be led by Judit Acsády, a sociologist and senior research fellow at the Sociology Institute of the Institute for Social Sciences of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

Participation in the walk is free, but if you are able to contribute the participation fee of 5,000 Ft per person (or a portion of it), you will be supporting the long-term accessibility of our programs to everyone.

If you are unable to attend after registering, please let us know by emailing: oktatas@kozeletiskolaja.hu.
