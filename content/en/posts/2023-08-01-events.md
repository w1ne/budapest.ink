 ### H치romezer sz치mozott darab

Event Announcement: "H치romezer sz치mozott darab" - A Hungarian Film Screening

Join us for a special screening of "H치romezer sz치mozott darab" at Bem Mozi in Budapest. The film is directed by Cs치szi 츼d치m and stars Farkas Franciska and Horv치th Krist칩f. Please note that the film is in Hungarian with no subtitles.

"H치romezer sz치mozott darab" tells the story of a theater director who creates a performance based on the lives of five young Roma individuals facing difficult circumstances. The play showcases the harsh realities of their lives, depicting their poverty. When the play is invited to a prestigious theater festival in Germany, the group members are forced to confront their past and challenge racist stereotypes.

The film takes the audience on a surreal journey, blurring the line between fiction, absurdity, and socio-graphic reality. Can we talk about race without racism? Is it inevitable for minorities and majorities to harbor mutual hatred?

The theatrical version of "H치romezer sz치mozott darab," titled "Cig치ny magyar," received critical acclaim and success among audiences in Hungary, leading to an invitation to the renowned Deutsches Theater in Berlin. Director Cs치szi 츼d치m adapted the play into a film, receiving the "Rebels with a Cause" award at the Tallinn Black Nights International Film Festival. Cs치szi's debut film, "Viharsarok," was shown at the Berlinale, winning numerous awards and being screened in 14 countries. We particularly recommend this film to fans of Ruben 칐stlund and Alejandro Jodorowsky.

Join us on Tuesday, August 1, 2023, at 6:00 PM for the screening of "H치romezer sz치mozott darab" at Bem Mozi, located at Margit k칬r칰t 5, Budapest. Tickets are priced at 1,600 Ft and can be purchased in three ways:
