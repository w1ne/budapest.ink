 ### Guided tour in English The Hungarian Cube. Modernity and Dwelling in the Kádár Era

### Guided Tour in English: "The Hungarian Cube. Modernity and Dwelling in the Kádár Era"

Join us for a fascinating journey through the architecture of the Kádár era in Hungary. Ludwig Museum invites you to explore the iconic Hungarian "cube house" in this special exhibition. This distinctive house with a hip roof, known as the Kádár cube, represents a unique form of architectural modernization that emerged in the 1960s and 70s.

The humble cube house, often overlooked, has shaped the landscape of Hungarian rural settlements for decades. Despite its initial criticism, this architectural style has proven to be a lasting symbol of 20th-century design. Linked to the prefab panel blocks, the cube houses played a crucial role in socialist housing construction during that era. Whether loved or loathed, these structures are an integral part of Hungary's cultural heritage.

Your guide for this enlightening tour is Kasztovszky Anna, who will provide insights and historical context in English. This guided tour offers a unique opportunity to delve into the legacy of the Kádár era architecture and its significance in Hungarian society.
