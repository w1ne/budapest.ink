 ### Nei Gong - Budapest - November

Nei Gong Course in Budapest - November

Join us for an advanced Nei Gong course in Budapest, Hungary. This event is a step up from the previous courses we have held in the past few years. We will be focusing on introducing the Hun Yuan Qigong exercises, which have been learned from Damo Mitchell.

Hun Yuan, meaning "original state," sets these exercises apart from the Level 1 syllabus. While Level 1 Qigong mainly focuses on the physical aspect, Hun Yuan Qigong is centered on the cultivation of energy and works according to different principles.

This event is open to those who have already spent a few years practicing the Lotus Nei Gong Level 1 syllabus. Most of the participants are individuals whom I have personally instructed or those whose instructors I know and have confirmed their readiness to attend.

During this course, we will delve into the dantians related to Hun Yuan Qigong, as well as cover as many exercises as possible within the span of three days.

The event will take place on the 25th-27th of November 2023 at Csepel Karate SE - 1214 Budapest, Kossuth Lajos utca 117. Participants have the option to attend either for two days or the full three-day duration.

The course fee for the two-day participation is 50,000 HUF, and for the three-day participation, it is 75,000 HUF. To complete your registration, please email neigongd@gmail.com. Please note that the registration is complete only after the fee transfer, so remember to include your name and address for invoice data.

For those who have used our EUR wise account before, you can still transfer the fee in euros. To give you an idea, the approximate fee in euros is 130 for two days and 200 for three days.

We look forward to seeing you at the Nei Gong course in Budapest. Thank you very much.

Adam Molnar, Qigong Instructor (Lotus Nei Gong affiliated member)

 ### INTERNATIONAL MASTER CLASS IN BUDAPEST // NOV. 23-27 // PAOLO ANTONIO SIMIONI & EUACT MEMBERS

International Master Class in Budapest // Nov. 23-27 // Paolo Antonio Simioni & EUACT Members

Join Paolo Antonio Simioni, renowned acting coach, for an incredible learning experience as he brings his International Master Class to Budapest. Taking place from November 23rd to November 27th, this course is based on the world-renowned teaching methods of Stanislavski, adapted specifically for the European culture. Whether you're an actor, playwright, director, scriptwriter, or screenplay writer, this master class is open to all.

One of the unique aspects of this master class is its inclusivity. Even if you don't speak any language other than Italian, you are welcome to participate. The group will provide assistance and support in helping you learn, and you are always free to work in your native language. Verbal language is not a limit or the primary objective of this course.

During the master class, you will have the opportunity to choose a character and work on a monologue. This can be something you're already working on for a project or any text that deeply interests you. Through deep analysis of your chosen character's psyche and exploration of their extremes, you will learn how to create a layered, original, and sensitive portrayal. The "method" taught in this course allows you to arrive at emotions naturally rather than forcing them.

Paolo works individually with each participant, ensuring that everyone gets personal attention. It is recommended to follow the work of others as well, either as a spectator or a scene partner. On the last day of the master class, a professional cameraman will record the scenes/monologues, which can be used for a showreel or future auditions. Additionally, this time spent together is an opportunity to develop new working relationships within the team, sharing experiences and advice for the future.

The master class will also have Italian actors present, allowing participants from each nation to draw inspiration from each other's methods and approaches. This cross-cultural exchange can foster creativity and broaden perspectives.

The master class is a 5-day intensive course, limited to 16 participants. The sessions will start at 10 am and continue late into the evening, with the option to leave during the day for important errands or work. The workshop will be conducted in Italian, Hungarian, and English, with translation provided by one of the fellow participants.

For actors, this master class aims to expand your technical toolbox, help you connect to the text through conscious work, develop your skills, and overcome any blocks you may have, both physical and psychological. It also encourages the expansion of your artistic ideas and teaches you how to work creatively with directors and dramatists.

For directors and dramatists, this master class provides an opportunity to learn how to analyze texts, reconcile the original objectives of the text with your creative drive, and effectively communicate your artistic concept with the actors.

Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity to learn from Paolo Antonio Simioni and his team of experienced actors. If you're interested, reach out to the Hungarian contact at sziabencevagyok@gmail.com or the Italian contact at info.euact@gmail.com. Limited spots are available, so secure your place now!
