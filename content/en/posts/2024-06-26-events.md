Breakups can be one of the most challenging life events, triggering a wave of emotions from anger and disappointment to sorrow and loneliness. Whether you initiated the breakup or found yourself on the receiving end, the end of a long-term relationship can feel like a crisis, impacting various aspects of your life simultaneously. You may find yourself grappling with guilt, questioning if you will ever feel whole again, and experiencing a range of post-breakup symptoms like insomnia, stress, and loneliness.

Our Breakup Recovery Support Group aims to provide a safe and supportive space where you can share your feelings with others who are going through a similar situation. Through 10 weekly sessions, we will explore different facets of the breakup journey, including the history of the relationship, coping techniques, frustrations post-breakup, future relationship expectations, and personal growth opportunities.

The group will consist of 6-12 participants, ensuring an intimate setting where everyone can contribute and receive support. As the facilitator, Brigitta Pusk√°s, a seasoned Breakup Recovery Coach with a background in psychology and group analysis, will guide you through the sessions, offering empathy, understanding, and valuable resources to aid in your healing process.

If you feel isolated in your breakup pain or hesitant to burden your friends with your emotions, our support group may be the perfect space for you to connect with others who understand and can offer valuable insights and perspectives. Additionally, a scholarship opportunity is available for individuals from marginalized communities. Email Brigitta Pusk√°s at brigittapuskas1@gmail.com for more information before 10/06/2024.

Don't navigate this challenging time alone. Join our "Life After The Breakup" support group and take the first step towards healing and growth.
