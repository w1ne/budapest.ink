### Visegr√°d Castle to Szentendre: Autumn Escape

**Date and Time:** To be announced  
**Location:** To be announced  
**Organizer:** Budapest Hikers  

Hello Hikers! Are you ready to kick off the new hiking season with an adventure to remember? Join us on a captivating autumn forest hike, showcasing the breathtaking beauty of Central Hungary. This expedition will take you through the enchanting scenery of the Danube-bend, the golden beech and oak forests of the Visegr√°d mountain range, the iconic castle ruins of Visegr√°d, and the enchanting Serbian old town of Szentendre.

Picture this: the ancient Visegr√°d castle, standing tall for over 800 years on a majestic 330-meter hill, offering panoramic views of the Danube. It's not just a castle; it's a historical landmark where the Czech, Polish, and Hungarian kings convened in 1335, initiating the age-old Visegr√°d cooperation in Central Europe.

As you saunter through Szentendre, a quaint town on the slopes of the Visegr√°d mountains, you'll be immersed in its picturesque streets and Serbian legacy. This town, steeped in history, became a haven for South Slavic refugees during the Middle Ages, infusing the area with their culture and architectural charm, resulting in the romantic downtown with its narrow cobbled pathways and baroque buildings.

This 24 km hike with a 600-meter ascent and descent will take approximately 7 hours to complete. While the trail is suitable for all hikers, don‚Äôt forget to lace up your sturdy trekking shoes for a comfortable journey. The ticket prices are 6000 HUF for students and 7000 HUF for regular participants, covering train rides, ferry trips, and entrance to the castle (dinner in Szentendre is optional).

Here's a glimpse of the schedule:
- 7:50 AM - Meeting at Nyugati railway station, platform number 5
- 8:50 AM - Arrival at Nagymaros-Visegr√°d railway station, followed by a ferry boat ride
- 10:00 AM - Ascending to the Visegr√°d castle
- 11:00 AM - Embarking on the forest hike
- 5:30 PM - Reaching Szentendre, exploring its riverside and historic downtown

Why should you join this hike?
- Witness one of Europe's most scenic castle ruins
- Wander through the charming streets of Szentendre
- Immerse yourself in the autumnal beauty of the forests
- Enjoy a ferry boat journey across the Danube

Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity to connect with fellow international hikers and make lasting memories. Feel free to invite your friends and make this journey a memorable one. We can't wait to hit the trails with you!
