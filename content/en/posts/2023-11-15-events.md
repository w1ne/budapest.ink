 ### Chanee Choi: Surreal Memories: Remembrance Project

**Chanee Choi: Surreal Memories: Remembrance Project**

Join us for an extraordinary and thought-provoking art experience, as Chanee Choi presents her biofeedback-driven performance art piece, "Surreal Memories: Remembrance Project." Taking place in Budapest at Nádor u. 15, Room 103, this event will also be available to experience online.

"Surreal Memories: Remembrance Project" takes you on a journey into the world of memory loss and artificial intelligence. Chanee Choi, the artist behind this captivating piece, delves into the emotional landscape of confronting early-onset Alzheimer's disease, a condition that has deeply affected her family.

Blending cutting-edge technology, such as machine learning and EEG sensors, this project crafts a live narrative that is guided by the brainwave activity of the artist. By erasing the boundaries between the observer and the participant, as well as between the real and the virtual worlds, Choi invites you to be an active part of this mesmerizing art experience.

In "Surreal Memories: Remembrance Project," Chanee Choi not only acts as the creative force but also takes on the role of the participant. By utilizing EEG input as both a technological medium and a metaphor for memory's transience, she confronts her own fears of inheriting Alzheimer's disease. The categorization of brainwaves into "concentrated" and "not concentrated" states adds an element of urgency to the experience. Maintaining focus allows the unfolding of the narrative, offering a visceral encounter with the complexities of Alzheimer's.

Symbolic disintegration vividly represents the impact of the disease on memory. Lapses in concentration lead to a powerful representation of the disintegration of memories. By creating an immersive setting and facing her fears head-on, Choi aims to delve into the nuances of Alzheimer's, liberating herself from her family's medical history. Through "Remembrance," she poses the question: what do we become when faced with the loss of our memories?

This mesmerizing art event promises to take you on a unique journey, where biofeedback, artificial intelligence, and emotional exploration come together to create a truly surreal experience. Don't miss the opportunity to witness the "Surreal Memories: Remembrance Project" by Chanee Choi.

To RSVP for this event, please contact Agnes Bendik at bendikag@ceu.edu.
