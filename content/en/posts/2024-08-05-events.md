### When and Where
- üìÖ **Date:** Monday, August 5, 2024
- üïí **Time:** 6:30‚ÄØPM ‚Äì 9:30‚ÄØPM CEST
- üìç **Location:** the ANT Collective (Tisza utca 11, Budapest, Hungary, 1133)

### Event Details
Are you ready to dive into the mystical world of ancient spiritual practices? Join us for **Magic Mondays** hosted by **How To Be A Conscious Human**. This week's theme is *"Initiation"*, where we will embark on a journey to unravel the secrets of a spiritual path that can transform your life.

Magic, or Magick, has a rich history dating back to ancient Sumeria, passing through various civilizations before arriving in modern times. But hold on, magic is not a religion! It's a spiritual path that offers you the chance to explore your consciousness beyond imagination.

Curious about what's in store for you during this event? You'll engage in meditations, simple rituals, and receive guidance on expanding your awareness. Whether you seek happiness, harmony, or wish to witness the wonders of creation, magic can open doors you never knew existed.

But what about healing or predicting the future? Yes, you'll learn about various healing methods and tools like tarot or i ching which can aid in physical, psychological, and spiritual well-being. And no, we won't be summoning demons or casting curses - this is a safe and welcoming space for all.

The event is open to everyone, regardless of your beliefs, experience, or level of skepticism. Your host, George Farley, a seasoned ceremonial magician and consciousness explorer, is excited to kickstart this spiritual voyage with you. Remember to bring some cash (3000 HUF) for the exchange, and if possible, a notebook to jot down your thoughts.

Don't miss this opportunity to discover your true self, connect with like-minded individuals, and enjoy a soothing cup of tea in the company of fellow seekers. Let's make this Monday truly magical! ‚ú®
