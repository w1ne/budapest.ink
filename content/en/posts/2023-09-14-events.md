 ### EMBER S√°ri: Id≈ëben t√∂rt√©nik | Happening in Time

Type: Art Exhibition
Title: EMBER S√°ri: Id≈ëben t√∂rt√©nik | Happening in Time
Date and Time: Thursday, September 14, 2023 at 6:00 PM (UTC+02)
Location: acb Gallery, 1068 Budapest, Kir√°ly utca 76.

The acb Gallery presents "EMBER S√°ri: Id≈ëben t√∂rt√©nik | Happening in Time," a solo exhibition featuring the works of Ember S√°ri. The exhibition will be open for viewing from September 15 to October 20, 2023, with the opening reception taking place on September 14 at 6:00 PM.

Ember S√°ri's exhibition can be interpreted as a personal exploration of the future, as well as a retrospective look at her creative journey over the past seven years. Through a selection of archaic motifs from collective memory, she examines the narrative capacity of constellations of objects.

Moving away from the genre of photography, Ember S√°ri's artistic practice has expanded to include a wide range of mediums such as stone, ceramics, textiles, photography, and paper collage. In her works, she not only questions the nature of representation but also deconstructs classic genres like portraiture and still life. Drawing on personal and collective histories, her pieces offer reinterpretations of memories, traditions, and rituals.

The exhibition features a comprehensive ensemble of ceramic objects that evoke the atmosphere of home. The objects are arranged in a way that articulates a generational question, enclosed within a tent. The stone and ceramic works incorporate familiar symbols of culture, such as the human eye, reclining figures, human couples, fire, spring water, trees, and animals.

Ember S√°ri, born in 1985 in S√£o Paulo, graduated from the Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design in Budapest, specializing in photography. Her diverse artistic practice showcases her talent in various mediums and her ability to rethink and reinterpret memories, traditions, and rituals.

Don't miss the opportunity to experience "EMBER S√°ri: Id≈ëben t√∂rt√©nik | Happening in Time" at the acb Gallery. Immerse yourself in Ember S√°ri's thought-provoking works and explore the narratives woven through her constellations of objects.

 ### AntiBME napok 2023

Dear friends of ELTE,

With the start of the new semester, it's once again time for the traditional AntiBME festival, a gathering of the entire university community for free food and festivities. But what exactly is AntiBME?

To put it in the words of the organizers from four years ago:

"You see, during this time, the BME Days are usually held, and to mitigate the noise from the outdoor concerts, they usually hang soundproof trash bags on the barriers. In other words, we gather at our own university, listen to great music for free, enjoy alcoholic drinks, and in some places, the glow of a hookah coal shines brightly."

We invite everyone to join us with love and completely free of charge!
