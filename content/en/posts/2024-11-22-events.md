 ### Swap Party

### Join Us at the Swap Party by Mira Intercultural Community Hungary!

Are you ready to refresh your wardrobe without spending a dime and help the environment at the same time? Then mark your calendars for the Swap Party happening on **22 November 2024**, from **18:00 to 20:00** at Mira Ház!

### What's a Swap Party?

A Swap Party is not just any gathering—it's a fun and eco-friendly event where community members come together to exchange items they no longer need or want. It's a fantastic opportunity to give your pre-loved items a new home and score some stylish new-to-you pieces without spending a penny!

### How It Works

Bring along any clothes, shoes, or accessories that are in good condition and swap them for new gems to take home! It's a great way to declutter your closet and give items a second chance while connecting with others in the community.

### Why Participate?

We all have those items in our closets that we haven't touched in ages. Instead of letting them collect dust, bring them to the Swap Party and trade them for something you'll actually use! Plus, all leftover items will be donated, so you're not just decluttering—you're making a positive impact.

### What to Bring

- Swap-worthy items
- A reusable shopping bag

Join us for a day filled with fashion, fun, and community spirit! Don't miss out on this opportunity to declutter sustainably and connect with like-minded individuals. See you there! 🌟

For registration and more information, visit [Mira Intercultural Community](https://mira-intercultural-community.motibro.com/home). 

Let's swap, connect, and make a difference together! 🌍👗👠
