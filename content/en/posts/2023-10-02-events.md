The latest issue of the magazine features essays and translations that offer historical and contemporary interpretations of "t√∂meg" (mass).

 ### Sz√©plaky Gerda: Az √âdenkert mint radik√°lis k√∂z√∂ss√©g - N√∂v√©nyetika az √ìsz√∂vets√©g nyom√°n

Title: Sz√©plaky Gerda: The Garden of Eden as a Radical Community - Plant Ethics in the Old Testament

Date and Time: To be announced

Location: 47.493043, 19.062394

Organizer: Biblical Studies ELTE Budapest

Description:

Join us for an enlightening presentation by Sz√©plaky Gerda titled "The Garden of Eden as a Radical Community - Plant Ethics in the Old Testament." In this lecture, Sz√©plaky Gerda will explore how the Old Testament describes the status of plants, whether in relation to creation, the idyllic Garden of Eden, or the interaction between humans and plants. 

Drawing from biblical texts and classical depictions of paradise, particularly the works of Jan Brueghel, the speaker will analyze the role of plants in these narratives. The presentation will demonstrate that although Judeo-Christian culture regards humans as superior beings endowed with power, and places plants at the bottom of the hierarchy of existence, plants actually play a privileged role. The plant's representation of life force and growth serves as the foundation upon which a new ethical thinking can be built.

Sz√©plaky Gerda is a philosopher, aesthete, and critic, as well as a professor at the Institute of Fine Arts and Art Theory at the Eszterh√°zy K√°roly Catholic University. She is the author and editor of philosophical, aesthetic, and artistic journals and monographs, and a member of research groups. Her latest book, "Neither God nor Animal: Chapters from the Deconstruction of Sacrificial Culture," was recently published (Budapest: Prae, 2023).

Don't miss this opportunity to delve into the fascinating connection between plants and ethics in the Old Testament. Stay tuned for further details regarding the date and time of the event.
