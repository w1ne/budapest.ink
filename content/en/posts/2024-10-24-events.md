 ### Guided tour in English by Zsolt Miklósvölgyi and Márió Z. Nemes in the exhibition Geisterknochen

## Geisterknochen Exhibition Guided Tour by Zsolt Miklósvölgyi and Márió Z. Nemes

Join editor and art writer Zsolt Miklósvölgyi and poet, critic, and art theoretician Márió Z. Nemes on a captivating guided tour in English at the exhibition *Technologie und das Unheimliche (T+U): Geisterknochen*. The event will take place on the 24th of October 2024, starting at 6 pm. This unique experience is organized by the Trafó Gallery and offers free entrance to all who are interested.

*Technologie und das Unheimliche (T+U): Geisterknochen* features artworks by Hynek Alt, Lőrinc Borsos, Aleksandr Delev, Miklós Erdély, Márk Fridvalszki, László Győrffy, Insane Temple, Július Koller, Tamás Komoróczky, Márió Z. Nemes, and Dominika Trapp. Curated by T+U (Márk Fridvalszki, Zsolt Miklósvölgyi, Márió Z. Nemes) and Borbála Szalai, this exhibition delves into the creative and theoretical practices of the past decade of the collective. 

Unravel the mysteries behind the exhibition's theme, which draws inspiration from Jacques Derrida's hauntology concept, challenging visitors to explore the haunted unconscious of techno-culture alongside other artists. Dive into a world where archaeology, geology, philosophy, and speculative futurisms collide, inviting you to contemplate our biological, geological, and cultural heritage. The exhibition sparks contemplation on our prehuman past and posthuman future, causing a burst of thought akin to the unexplained Tunguska event.

Delve deeper into the unique perspective presented through the exhibition's title, where Hegel's notion of the spirit as a bone intertwines with ideas of human existence as a phantom-like remnant of non-human materiality. Explore the notion that not only are we surrounded by ghostly temptations but we ourselves are also ghosts in the narrative of existence. The exhibition reflects not just a mere excavation but a spiritual séance merging past phantoms with contemporary artistic expressions.

Get ready for an artistic journey unlike any other, as you explore the intricate layers of *Technologie und das Unheimliche (T+U): Geisterknochen* through the eyes of Zsolt Miklósvölgyi and Márió Z. Nemes. Mark your calendars for this enlightening experience that promises to challenge your perceptions and ignite your imagination.
