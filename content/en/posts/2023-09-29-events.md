 ### XIV. Ötvösművészeti Biennále - csoportos kiállítás

Join us at the XIV. Ötvösművészeti Biennále - csoportos kiállítás, the largest national exhibition of contemporary metal art. The exhibition opening will take place on Friday, September 29, 2023, at 6:00 PM UTC+02, at the Klebelsberg Kultúrkúria in Budapest, located at Templom u. 2-10.

We are honored to have Őrsi Gergely, the mayor of the II. district, as the patron of the event.

We are also delighted to have Serbakow Tibor, a metal artist and president of the Metal Art Department of the Hungarian Association of Fine and Applied Arts, who will share his insights.

The Biennále is organized in collaboration with the Hungarian Association of Fine and Applied Arts and is being held for the ninth time at the Kultúrkúria. Many of the artworks presented have been created in honor of the Petőfi 200 Memorial Year.

PETŐFI 200
Freedom, love, patriotism, heroism - these words are synonymous with the great poet and his personality. In his own words, "In front of me, every person is worth as much as the value of their heart. I could easily make friends with someone who committed a thousand wrongs in their passion for me, rather than with a cold person who would do a thousand good things for me. A burning heart, a burning heart! or the icy grave!... Oh my God, if my warm, fervent heart would ever cool down... but no, this can't happen. Even death cannot chill my heart. Bury me at night and plant an orange tree next to my grave; you will see that it will bloom there too because my heart will warm the earth in which it will lie."

Admission to the exhibition is free and it will be open to the public from September 29th to October 22nd, 2023, from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM daily. Don't miss the opportunity to witness the best of contemporary Hungarian metal art.
