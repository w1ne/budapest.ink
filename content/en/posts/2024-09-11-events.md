 ### A world of faces: exhibition closing collage workshop by Daniel Hedin

### A World of Faces: Exhibition Closing Collage Workshop by Daniel Hedin

Join us for the finnisage event of "A World of Faces" exhibition by Daniel Hedin at Madách Imre út 5, Budapest, Hungary, organized by Központ.

As the faces have adorned our walls throughout the summer, we now invite you to a collage workshop to mark the closing of this mesmerizing exhibition. This workshop is not just about creating art; it's about tapping into your intuition, finding your focus, and letting your creativity flow freely. While various collage-making techniques will be explored, the primary focus is on guiding individuals to trust in their creative abilities, instincts, and emotions.

In a world filled with distractions, finding focus and being present is a rare gift. With the incessant noise of social media and the fast-paced city life, the workshop aims to draw attention to the importance of focusing, creating, and breaking free from conventional rules in the realm of artistry. When we discover our unique focus in the creative process, it becomes a healing and liberating journey that allows us to connect with our inner voice and, in turn, with others around us.

About the artist: Daniel Hedin is a multi-artist hailing from Sweden, who has been making waves in Budapest's art scene since his arrival less than two years ago. His portfolio includes sound art, live performances, collages, poetry, and dance. Daniel believes that art is not a fixed identity but rather a fluid and formless medium through which we express ourselves, adapt, and evolve.

Don't miss this opportunity to delve into the world of collage art and unleash your creativity alongside Daniel Hedin. Let's celebrate art, intuition, and self-expression together!

*Stay tuned for the date and time of the workshop.*
