 ### VASARELY x FAJÓ – Guided tour in English by Delia Vekony

### VASARELY x FAJÓ - Guided Tour in English by Delia Vekony

Don't miss out on the final opportunity to join Hungarian Art & Business (HAB) for a captivating guided tour in English, led by HAB's director, Delia Vekony. Step into the world of an extraordinary artistic collaboration that transcended the Iron Curtain.

At the center of this fascinating narrative are two key figures - the op-art sensation, Hungarian-born Victor Vasarely (1906-1997), who found a new home in France, and János Fajó (1937-2018), a stalwart of the modernist tradition of geometric abstraction in socialist Hungary. Together, they embraced the power of modern aesthetic forms, contributing to a global recognition of their artistry. Their combined efforts produced a series of remarkable works, including screen prints and multiples that, despite their creation within the confines of the Hungarian People's Republic, became integral parts of Vasarely's artistic legacy.

Vasarely, with his visionary approach, strategically used art - particularly his popular op-art style - to challenge the Soviet establishment's aversion to abstractionism during the Cold War era. Fajó played a crucial role in this narrative, facilitating the dissemination of their art through the private art market resurgence of the 1980s. As Fajó aptly summarized Vasarely's ambition, "he wanted to expand, to conquer the world," a sentiment that encapsulates the grandeur of their collaborative vision.

The exhibition, culminating on the 18th of September, unveils this intriguing tale through a showcase of Vasarely and Fajó's works, displayed together for the first time. Immerse yourself in the untold story of their partnership and the artistic dialogue that unfolded across borders and ideologies.

Join us for this unmissable event that promises a blend of art, history, and cultural exchange. The guided tour provides a unique opportunity to gain insights into the creative minds of these two artists and the impact of their collaboration on the art world. Admission is free, making it accessible to all art enthusiasts eager to explore the depths of this remarkable artistic journey.

Prepare to be enthralled by the intertwining narratives of Vasarely and Fajó as you delve into the world of op-art, geometric abstraction, and the enduring legacy of artistic innovation. This event is a celebration of creativity, collaboration, and the transcendent power of art to bridge boundaries and inspire change.

Don't let this opportunity slip away - mark your calendars and join us for an unforgettable guided tour that promises to leave a lasting impression. Experience the magic of Vasarely x Fajó and discover a world where art knows no bounds.

Let's embark on this artistic adventure together and witness the beauty of collaborative genius unfold before your eyes.

See you there!
