 ### #Trafó25 - 25 éves a Trafó! - születésnap

#Trafó25 - 25 éves a Trafó! - születésnap

Join us as we celebrate Trafó's 25th anniversary on October 13, 2023, with a day filled with free programs, film screenings, and concerts. We'll be taking you on a journey through space and time, with events happening both on the Nehru part and in the Trafó House. Get ready for dance performances, installations, a reflection on the past, film screenings, and of course, plenty of music and dance.

The festivities kick off at 4:00 PM with a captivating performance by the OneTwoMany Collective & Collective Dope you are the flow on the Nehru part. This participatory dance showcase fuses contemporary dance, parkour, and urban dance styles. Witness the joyous dance that emerges from a continuous flow of energy, where individuality and beauty shine through. And don't forget, you can even join in and experience the currents that carry the performers.

Afterwards, all the birthday programs will take place in the main Trafó building. At 5:00 PM, you can explore the Fermented Futures installation by Tekla Gedeon and Sebastian Gschanes, in collaboration with Zsófia Szonja Illés, Sándor Guba, and szabadonbalaton. This unique exhibit sheds light on urgent ecological challenges through the sharing of various knowledge, narratives, and food. Please note that this program requires registration, so make sure to secure your spot.

At 6:00 PM, the Trafó Archive will be presented by the Trafó team. Discover the history of the House through an interactive corner set up in front of the Main Hall. Dive into the past and learn about the countless dance performances from the Far East, the evolution of the Trafó logo, politically charged theater productions by Hungarian independents, the exploration of identity through artistic genres, and much more. Through virtual collections comprising thousands of archival documents, the spirit of Trafó will come alive.

At 7:00 PM, join Krisztián Török, curator of MODEM Modern and Contemporary Art Center, for a guided tour of the Trafó Gallery. The latest exhibition, titled "Floor is Lava," takes its name from the popular game familiar to gamers and reality show enthusiasts. As you navigate the dangers of the lava floor, metaphorically representing the tensions between conservative heteropatriarchal social structures and critical feminist and queer discourses, you'll also reframe your relationship with the environment.

In the evening, starting at 8:00 PM, the main hall will host two remarkable performances accessible with a Trafó25 ticket. First, experience the premiere of "Ó_25: What kind of animal is Trafó?", a film by Márton K. Takács and Soma Kazsimér, as they explore the essence of Trafó through their unique lens. Then, get ready to dance the night away with a vibrant concert by Los Orangutanes, Hungary's favorite band that brings the infectious rhythms of cumbia, South America's most popular music genre, to the forefront.

Make sure to grab your tickets online or at the Trafó box office for the evening performances, which are available for just 625 HUF. Let's come together and celebrate Trafó's 25th anniversary in style!
