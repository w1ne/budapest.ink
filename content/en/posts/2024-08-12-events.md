### Nehru-part - Free Guided Tour and Community Cleanup

**Date and Time:** Monday, August 12, 2024 at 6:30 PM – 7:30 PM CEST

**Organizer:** Bálint Lilla

Hey there, internet friends! Are you ready to embark on an adventure that combines exploration, community spirit, and a touch of eco-friendliness? Join us for the Nehru-part free guided tour and community cleanup happening on Monday, August 12, 2024, from 6:30 PM to 7:30 PM CEST in Budapest.

We'll delve into the vibrant heart of the Pest embankments, guided by the knowledgeable Lilla, as we uncover the secrets of community urban planning, local history, and the significance behind Nehru-part's unique name. The area, once dominated by sleek industrial structures, has now been reclaimed by nature. We'll discuss urban biodiversity, the impact of climate change on cities, and the pivotal role of the river in Budapest's landscape.

But that's not all - as we soak in the sights and stories, we'll also be rolling up our sleeves and participating in a community cleanup. Let's give back to nature by picking up trash and contributing to the preservation of this urban oasis. Remember to BYOG - Bring Your Own Gloves! If you can, bring along some plastic bags to collect garbage. Don't worry if you forget, as extra bags will be available.

Our meeting point is in front of the Boráros Skatepark, located at 1093. Boráros Tér 1. - Nehru Part, under the iconic Petőfi Bridge. Look out for Lilla and the group - we'll be hanging around this spot for the first 10 minutes before setting off. You can also join us later or catch up wherever you spot us in the park.

Lilla, our passionate guide, is a Budapest enthusiast with a talent for weaving together tales from different cultures and eras. Her guided city walks are not just about sightseeing; they're about forging connections, exploring urban narratives, and building a stronger sense of community.

So, mark your calendars, gather your gloves, and get ready to discover Nehru-part like never before. Let's make a difference, one step at a time, in the heart of Budapest!
