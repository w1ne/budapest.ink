 ### I. Gitárfesztivál a Füvészkertben

The I. Gitárfesztivál a Füvészkertben (First Guitar Festival in the Botanical Garden) is a two-day event that will take place on August 4th and 5th. The festival will showcase the talents of both international and Hungarian solo acoustic guitar artists. The unique setting of the botanical garden provides the perfect backdrop for an incredible musical experience that awaits the audience.

On August 4th, the lineup includes Marc Perin from Italy, a young guitar prodigy who has already released four studio albums. Perin uses fingerstyle guitar technique enriched with percussive elements and draws inspiration from artists like Rodrigo y Gabriela, Tommy Emmanuel, and Andrea Valeri. Légrády Péter, one of the pioneers of fingerstyle guitar in Hungary, will also perform. As a member of the band 100 Folk Celsius, he has performed in numerous concerts, toured Europe, and even played in the United States. He is not only an artist but also a teacher, having influenced many representatives of the acoustic music scene. Tom Lumen, the host of the festival, will also take the stage. He is an internationally renowned guitar virtuoso who has toured in 15 countries worldwide. His diverse music incorporates elements of blues, jazz, rock, and Hungarian folk music, and he also shares personal stories related to his songs with the audience.

On August 5th, the lineup includes Stano Pocaji from Slovakia, one of the most well-known acoustic guitarists in Slovakia. He skillfully combines jazz improvisation with fingerstyle technique. Pocaji has performed solo, in duos, and in various band formations all around the world. With his charming personality, humorous stories, and of course, his amazing guitar skills, he quickly wins the hearts of the audience. Papp Sándor, a finalist of the 1990 Paris Guitar Competition, will also perform. He regularly gives concerts and conducts courses both in Hungary and abroad. He has performed around the world from Australia to Mexico. Since 2019, he has been the director of the Bartók Béla Institute of Music at the University of Miskolc. His repertoire includes classical and Latin elements, and his recordings are regularly played on Bartók Radio. He obtained his doctoral degree in performance from the Bratislava Conservatory in 2007. Crossing Strings, an exciting cross-over guitar duo from Austria, will also be performing. The duo consists of fingerstyle guitarist Markus Schlesinger, who is already known to the Hungarian audience, and classical guitarist Carina Lindner. These artists from seemingly opposite worlds complement each other perfectly. Alongside their own compositions, they also perform jazz, blues, and various well-known melodies, occasionally adding their excellent vocal harmonies.

For those attending the concerts, it is worth arriving early to admire the beauty of the botanical garden. On the morning of Saturday, there will be a guitar workshop led by Stano Pocaji, focusing on fingerstyle guitar technique in jazz improvisation. Participation in the workshop is free for ticket holders, but registration is required due to limited availability.
