 ### A Freeszfe Egyesület bemutatja: Az üvegbura

Title: A Freeszfe Association Presents: "The Glass Bell" - A Theatrical Exploration of Taboo Subjects

Event Description:
Join us for an intriguing and thought-provoking theatrical production, as A Freeszfe Egyesület presents "The Glass Bell". This unique performance delves into the complexities of silence and the struggle to communicate when words fail us. It explores themes of femininity, strange parties, unattainable men, and affluent female writers. 

One of the central topics examined is suicide and its longing, an immensely taboo subject that continues to affect individuals from all walks of life, even those who seemingly have it all. Drawing inspiration from Sylvia Plath's cult novel, Esther Greenwood serves as a poignant representation of alienation and disconnection.

This production aims to shed light on the profound impact that these hidden struggles have on individuals, ultimately sparking conversations about mental health, societal expectations, and the power of storytelling. 

Date and Time:
The performance will take place on Tuesday, September 19, 2023, at 7:00 PM UTC+02.

Location:
The venue for the event is yet to be announced. Stay tuned for further updates!

Organizer:
The event is organized by Trafó House, a renowned cultural center that supports and promotes various art forms, including theater, dance, and contemporary art.

Don't miss this captivating and thought-provoking performance that challenges social taboos and invites audiences to reflect on the complex nature of human experience. Stay updated about the venue and other details by visiting trafo.hu/programok/szinhaz_freeszfe_egyesulet_az_uvegbura.
