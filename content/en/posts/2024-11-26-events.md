 ### Éloïse Adde előadása / A public lecture of Éloïse Adde

### Public Lecture by Éloïse Adde: "Is that relevant to speak of a medieval nation?"

Are you fascinated by medieval history and the concept of nations in the past? Join the ELTE BTK Doctoral Programme in Medieval and Early Modern European History for a thought-provoking public lecture by Éloïse Adde titled "Is that relevant to speak of a medieval nation? A reflection based on the cases of Brabant and Bohemia in the fourteenth century."

In this captivating lecture, Éloïse Adde will delve into the debate surrounding the concept of nationhood in the medieval period. Contrary to popular belief, nations and nation-states were not creations of the modern era but had significant political implications even back then. By examining the cases of urbanized Brabant and feudal Bohemia between 1300-1450, Adde will explore how these regions embodied a sense of nationhood through complex social structures and linguistic dynamics.

The public lecture will take place at the ELTE BTK Institute of History Szekfű Gyula Library, located at 1088 Múzeum krt. 6-8. I. em. 116, on 26th November 2024 (Tuesday) at 16:00. This event is supported by the ELTE BTK Faculty Scientific Grant.

Don't miss this opportunity to gain insights into the medieval understanding of nations and how it shaped power struggles and socio-political balances in Brabant and Bohemia. Mark your calendars and immerse yourself in the intriguing world of medieval history with Éloïse Adde. See you there!
