Their invention changed the course of history during World War II and likely prevented a full-scale armed conflict between the two superpowers during the Cold War.

 ### Zvezda Beta & Andras Bader a RAKPARTON 游꿨

Hey everyone! In August, it will be worth visiting the lower embankment in Pest. We have an event that should be on everyone's bucket list, where you can dance your way into the weekend with the unparalleled panoramic view of Buda, while Zvezda Beta and Andras Bader provide the music.

For the first time this year, the embankment will be closed for a whole month, and everyone will find something they enjoy. Whether you want to sit and watch the sunset, enjoy the background music with the beautiful view of Gellert Hill, Buda Castle, and the Fisherman's Bastion, or kickstart your weekend in the embrace of the speakers.

From 16:00 to 22:00, Zvezda Beta & Andras Bader will be performing. The event is free, and you can get refreshing drinks at Viadukt Terasz.

This summer, between June 17 and September 24, the lower embankment in Pest, on the section between the Chain Bridge and Elizabeth Bridge, specifically on Jane Haining rakpart, will be closed for traffic on weekends. This allows us to create a leisure park and a temporary public space that brings people closer to the urban areas and the river. RAKPART~2023 is all about community and our river.

Besides the constant relaxation, dog walking, hanging out with kids, biking, and chatting, RAKPART is also a place for organized programs such as yoga classes, acoustic concerts, or marathon game nights. The VIADUKT hosts programs organized by civil and cultural organizations.

If you would like to organize a program on the embankment on future weekends, you can apply with your ideas here: [link].

RAKPART~2023 is part of the Budapest 150 program series, in collaboration with the Municipality of Budapest, Valyo - City and River Association, and Budapest Brand.

(Please note that photos and videos may be taken at the event. By attending the event, participants grant permission for their appearance and statements to be recorded and shared, with the explicit consent of the participant.)

Join us in lighting a candle to commemorate the separation of Hungary's Faith and Hungary's State.

After the commemoration, we will take a tour of Budapest to visit the places where the late couple frequented and shared their memories.
