 ### Zvezda Beta & Andras Bader a RAKPARTON 🎶

Hey guys! In August, it will be worth visiting the lower promenade in Pest. We have a bucket list event for you, where you can dance your way into the weekend with the unparalleled panoramic view of Buda, while Zvezda Beta and Andras Bader provide the music. 

For the first time this year, the promenade will be closed for a whole month, and everyone will find their preferred activity, whether it's enjoying a sunset, listening to music with the breathtaking backdrop of the Gellert Hill, Buda Castle, and Fisherman's Bastion, or starting the weekend off with the embrace of speakers. 

16:00 - 22:00 Zvezda Beta & Andras Bader. The event is free, and you can get refreshments at Viadukt Terasz. 

RAKPART~2023. This summer, between June 17th and September 24th, the section of the lower promenade in Pest, between Chain Bridge and Elizabeth Bridge, is closed to car traffic on weekends. This allows us to create a resting park, a temporary public space that brings people closer to urban areas and the river. RAKPART~2023 is about community and our river.

In addition to the constant chilling, walking dogs, and enjoying the company of children, the promenade also provides a space for organized programs, such as yoga classes, acoustic concerts, or marathon game sessions. The VIADUKT hosts programs organized by civil and cultural organizations.

YOU CAN ALSO ORGANIZE PROGRAMS:
If you want to organize a program on the promenade for the upcoming weekends, apply with your idea here: [https://bit.ly/rakpart2023](https://bit.ly/rakpart2023)

RAKPART~2023 is part of the Budapest 150 event series, realized in collaboration with the Budapest Municipality, the Valyo - City and River Association, and Budapest Brand.

Icicle, a versatile and skilled Dutch producer, rose to prominence in the mid-2000s within the drum and bass scene. He has released music under renowned labels such as Hospital, Soul:R, Critical, and Renegade Hardware.

Icicle has been a frequent guest at Bladerunnaz events, but this upcoming Friday performance holds a sad significance as he has decided to retire from his DJ career. This may very well be the last opportunity to witness him perform in Budapest, so make sure not to miss out on this special occasion.
