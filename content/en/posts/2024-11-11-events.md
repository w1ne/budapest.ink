 ### Magick Monday - Insights and Methods to Know Yourself

# Magick Monday - Insights and Methods to Know Yourself

Are you ready to dive into the secrets of an ancient spiritual path and unlock your full potential? Join us for **Magic Mondays** with Integral Magick! This is more than just a casual gathering; it's an opportunity to explore meditations, simple rituals, and guidance that can elevate your consciousness to new heights. Imagine living a happier, more harmonious life, witnessing the wonders of creation, and improving your material well-being - the possibilities are endless when you tap into the realms of magic.

**But what exactly is magic? Is it a religion?** Magic, also known as Magick, traces its roots back to ancient Sumeria, journeying through Egypt, Greece, Rome, and beyond, before arriving here with you. While magic incorporates the symbolism of various religions, it stands alone as a spiritual path without the confines of a specific belief system. It's not about blind faith or idol worship; instead, it's a journey of self-discovery and empowerment.

**What can you expect during our sessions?** You'll delve into basic spiritual practices aimed at expanding your awareness of the spiritual realm. From meditations to simple rituals to sharpening your psychic senses, you'll embark on a transformational journey. Whether you're new to magic or a seasoned practitioner, these foundational practices are open to everyone, regardless of their background or beliefs.

**Can magic help in healing and predicting the future?** Absolutely! The techniques you'll learn have the potential to address physical, psychological, and spiritual ailments. And when it comes to divination tools like tarot cards or the i ching, they offer insights and guidance rather than crystal-clear predictions. Magic is about honing your intuition and connecting with the energies around you.

**Will there be demonic summoning or curse casting?** Rest assured, that's not part of our agenda. Magic Mondays are a safe and inclusive space for all, irrespective of your beliefs or level of skepticism. It's a welcoming environment where you can explore, learn, and grow.

Join us every Monday from 18:30 to 21:30 at the ANT Collective in Budapest (Tisza utca 11, 1133 Hungary). The exchange for this enlightening experience is 3000 HUF (cash only at the moment). Don't forget to bring a notebook along for your journey of self-discovery with our host, George Farley - a seasoned ceremonial magician, philosopher, and consciousness explorer.

Come with an open mind and a curious spirit as we embark on this magical voyage together. See you there! ‚ú®üîÆ‚ú®
