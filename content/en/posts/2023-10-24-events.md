 ### First Came The Shadow [FR] @SzimplaROCKS

Title: First Came The Shadow [FR] @SzimplaROCKS: An Immersive Post-Rock Experience

Description: Get ready to be swept away by the mesmerizing sounds of First Came The Shadow, a post-rock quartet hailing from Nice. On an undefined date, Szimpla Kert will host this talented band, taking you on a journey through richly textured harmonic progressions that paint wide soundscapes of wonder, rage, and melancholy. Prepare to be captivated by their music, which skillfully combines emotions and explores the depths of human experience.

First Came The Shadow was formed in 2017, and since then, they have been crafting their unique post-rock sound. After the release of their first EP "Premonition" in May 2018, the band embarked on several successful tours in France and neighboring countries such as Spain and Portugal. Their passionate performances have earned them a reputation as a must-see live act.

In March 2020, First Came The Shadow released their album "Aridity," which delves into the fateful collapse of the post-modern world and the consequences of human actions. This conceptually driven album reflects the band's ability to create thought-provoking and introspective music that resonates with listeners on a profound level.

Now, First Came The Shadow is bringing their remarkable talent to Szimpla Kert, creating an immersive experience that will leave a lasting impression. The band's ability to blend elements of wonder, rage, and melancholy in their music ensures a dynamic and emotionally charged performance that will transport you to another realm.
