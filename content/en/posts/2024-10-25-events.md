### About the Event
Welcome to **Play in Progress**, an exhibition showcasing mixed media artworks by S√°ri Sz√°nt√≥ & Dasha Sz. This unique collection of artworks is a result of a playful collaboration where creativity knows no boundaries. The artists engage in a dynamic back-and-forth process of creation, where one initiates a design element and the other builds upon it in a continuous flow of artistry.

Each piece is an experiment in spontaneity and allows the artists to relinquish control, letting the process dictate the outcome. The exhibition is a glimpse into an ongoing creative journey, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in the joy of artistic exploration.

### Event Highlights

Workshops conducted during the exhibition offer a chance for participants to experience the collaborative and free-flowing approach to art-making. The overarching message of the event is to inspire others to embrace creativity, spontaneity, and playfulness in their own lives.

### Conclusion

It encourages visitors to let go of preconceived notions and immerse themselves in the process of creation. By showcasing the beauty of unfettered imagination and the magic of collaborative artistry, S√°ri Sz√°nt√≥ & Dasha Sz invite everyone to join them in the playful world of artistic exploration. Let's create something together!
