 ### Csillagf√ºrd≈ë - Hangf√ºrd≈ë a v√°ros felett, a csillagok alatt

Join us for the Csillagf√ºrd≈ë - Hangf√ºrd≈ë a v√°ros felett, a csillagok alatt event, organized by Hang√∂lel√©s. Experience the healing power of live music, the soothing sound of the violin, the enchanting melody of the handpan, and the blissful silence that nurtures, heals and elevates. This event connects the heavens with the earth through you, guiding you towards your inner light. It helps initiate processes of purification and self-healing.

I am Szabolcs Cseke, a music educator, the creator of children's shows such as "T√ºcs√∂kszabi," the "T√ºcs√∂kmantra √ñr√∂mzene," the "√ñr√∂m√≥ra," and the founder of HANG√ñLEL√âS. I am an ambassador of love, joy, and freedom. My mission is to spread the healing power of music and to bring people together through shared mantra chanting, the heartfelt sound of the violin, and the harmonizing power of the handpan. Together, we can find harmony with nature, the transcendental, our fellow human beings, and ourselves.

This moment embodies WHOLENESS. It is a path towards healing and self-fulfillment. Join us for a group immersion in the sea of music, the gentle swaying to the melodies of the violin and the "three in harmony." Let's sing some cleansing Hungarian mantras together. All of this while lying in the grass, above the city, embraced by the stars. This hour and a half is dedicated to quieting your mind and allowing your inner light to shine. It is a time of peaceful presence in the realm of release, forgiveness, and gratitude.

Please bring a blanket or mat, 2000 forints, your beautiful voices, and your inner silence.

With love,
Szabolcs Cseke (sound therapist) and Gerg≈ë F√ºzessy (handpan artist)

 ### A Francia Kiad√°s I M√©rce Filmklub Extra

The Francia Kiad√°s I M√©rce Filmklub Extra event is going to take place on Monday, August 14, 2023, from 7:00 PM to 10:30 PM UTC+02. The event is organized by Nyolc√©sf√©l and will be held at Nyolc√©sf√©l in Budapest.

The event will feature a screening of the film "A Francia Kiad√°s" (The French Dispatch) directed by Wes Anderson. The film tells the story of the last issue of a fictional French-based American magazine, which comes to life through a series of short films. Wes Anderson's distinctive nostalgic and eclectic style offers a unique portrayal of journalism, presenting a vision that appears to be old-fashioned but is timeless.

The film explores the question of whether a journalist can correct a manifesto written by student protesters. Although the film departs from reality, it may provide an affirmative answer to this question. The event will not only discuss the themes depicted in the film but will also focus on independent journalism at M√©rce, a Hungarian newspaper dedicated to modern art and cuisine.

After the screening, two editors from M√©rce, Juh√°sz-Boylan Kincs≈ë and Kiss Soma √Åbrah√°m, will join as guests to talk about their work in relation to the film. The event will take place at Nyolc√©sf√©l, and it is recommended to arrive early to secure a seat.

The Francia Kiad√°s screening is part of the "Live on M√©rce!" exhibition, which showcases the best press photos from the past six years of M√©rce's coverage of important political events in Hungary. The exhibition aims to highlight the visual storytelling capabilities of M√©rce and raise funds to support the work of their photographers and videographers. By donating or bidding on the exhibited prints, attendees can contribute to the daily operations of M√©rce and help document and share crucial moments of resistance and struggle.

If you are interested in attending this unique film club event and engaging in a discussion about journalism and independent media, join us at Nyolc√©sf√©l on August 14. Support M√©rce's important work and be part of the fight for our rights and spaces! For more information about M√©rce, please visit their website at [link](https://merce.hu/mi-a-merce/).

 ### Madalitso Band (MAW)

Join us for an exciting and authentic musical experience with the Madalitso Band (MAW) from Malawi. This dynamic duo has taken Europe by storm with their instinctive, authentic, and captivating rhythms. With their foot-stomping beats, guitar melodies, and the unique three-meter-long, single-stringed instrument called babatone, Madalitso Band will make you clap, dance, and smile during their live performance. Get ready to challenge your preconceptions of African sound and instrumentation as the band takes you on a journey of rethinking everything you thought you knew about African music.

Madalitso Band released their debut album, "Wasalala," in 2019, followed by "Musakayike" in 2022. These uplifting and vibrant albums quickly gained popularity in Europe, including various festivals, establishing the duo's reputation as talented musicians. It's hard to believe that just ten years ago, they were busking on the streets. Their minimalist setup consists of a homemade one-string slide bass guitar (babatone), a cowhide foot-drum played with the heel of a shoe, and a four-string guitar. Yosefe Kalekeni's guitar sets the rhythm, while lead vocalist Yobu Malinga's babatone brings depth and takes on a leading role.

When asked why they make their own instruments, they simply reply, "because that's how we get the sound we want to achieve." When they're not touring, Yobu Malinga performs daily prayers with his babatone at home, and Yosefe Kalekeni molds clay bricks. However, in Malawi and its surroundings, they are increasingly revered as musical prophets.

The event will take place at the Hungarian Music House, on the Open-Air Stage. Don't miss out on this incredible experience on Monday, August 14, 2023, at 8:00 PM ‚Äì 9:30 PM UTC+02.

For more information about the event, please visit the Hungarian Music House website at [https://zenehaza.hu/esemeny/madalitso-band-maw](https://zenehaza.hu/esemeny/madalitso-band-maw). The Open-Air Stage is a covered venue, so the event will take place even in case of rain.
