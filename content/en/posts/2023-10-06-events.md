 ### Tóth Laura: Follia

Tóth Laura: Follia

Join us for an evening of dance and self-expression as we present Tóth Laura: Follia. Translated as "Madness," this choreography explores the conflict between the external world and our internal experiences. In a society where everyone pretends that everything is fine, what happens when you're the one who feels pain? Is it really right to conform to what others do?

Who are you in this system? How long will you allow yourself to be suppressed? It's maddening when we don't know where the truth lies. Are they passive-aggressive, or are you paranoid? Are you monotonous or secure, ungrateful or justified, hardworking or taken advantage of? Meanwhile, our surroundings don't let us rest; they demand that we adhere to the norms they represent.

But how do we process the resulting anxiety? Perhaps by going a little mad ourselves: with some singing, tongue twisters, and lots of dancing.

The performance will last approximately 45 minutes and will be choreographed by Tóth Laura. The talented dancers involved are Baumgartner Krisztina, Békési-Szombati Anett/Tóth Laura, Mangi Kornélia, and Szilvási Anna. The music will be composed by Matisz Flóra Lili, with costumes designed by Henez Mariann and lighting by Dézsi Kata. The mentor for this project is Duda Éva, and we extend our gratitude to Molnár Csaba for his contributions.

We would also like to thank our supporters: Edelényi Tamás, NKA Imre Zoltán Program, Új Előadóművészeti Alapítvány, SÍN Kulturális Központ, and Műhely Alapítvány.

Don't miss this captivating performance that delves into the complexities of our inner struggles and the search for truth. Join us on Friday, October 6, 2023, at 7:00 PM UTC+02 at the coordinates 47.472846, 19.047240. Tickets can be purchased at [jegy.hu link].

Come experience the "madness" with us and explore the boundaries of self-expression through dance. Let the music, costumes, and lighting guide you on a journey of deep introspection and liberation. See you there!

 ### Székely Nadin és Gáti Ráhel︱kiállítás

Székely Nadin and Gáti Ráhel Exhibition

We are excited to announce the upcoming exhibition featuring the works of Székely Nadin and Gáti Ráhel. The exhibition will be held at reset art space and will be open from October 6 to October 20.

The opening reception will take place on October 6 at 7:00 PM. This is a great opportunity to meet the artists in person and learn more about their creative process.

The mystical experience, according to Henri Bergson, is primarily a momentum rather than an intellectual revelation or emotional overflow. The great mystics throughout history have expressed this experience in various ways, often relying on their actions and existence rather than words. Their writings may not have been widely known or accessible to the masses, yet their impact and momentum have been absorbed.

Székely Nadin, a graduate of MKE with a focus on painting, will be showcasing her unique artwork in this exhibition. You can follow her on Instagram at [@nadoja_](https://www.instagram.com/nadoja_/).

Gáti Ráhel, who has a background in animation from MOME, will also be presenting her captivating work. Follow her journey on Instagram at [@gati.rachel](https://www.instagram.com/gati.rachel/).

The exhibition will be held at reset art space located at Homok utca 3. This art venue is known for its vibrant and thought-provoking exhibitions. Don't miss the chance to witness the artistic brilliance of these two talented artists.

For more information about the exhibition and other events at reset art space, you can visit their Instagram page at [@re_______set](https://www.instagram.com/re_______set/).

 ### Tisza-tó, az ember alkotta paradicsom | Közönségtalálkozó

Tisza-tó, az ember alkotta paradicsom (Tisza Lake, the paradise created by man) is a Hungarian nature documentary film that showcases the beauty and uniqueness of the Tisza Lake. The Tisza River has been meandering through the Great Hungarian Plain for thousands of years. However, ever since humans appeared on its banks, they have been trying to harness its power and serve its purpose. The river's water has been used for drinking, irrigation, and even manipulated to create a large reservoir five decades ago.

Little did they know that their creation would give birth to a special habitat. The release of the river's water led to the formation of a unique ecosystem, where man-made structures were embraced by nature. This is how the Tisza Lake, the paradise created by man, came into being.

The film, narrated by Ljasuk Dimitry, takes viewers on a journey through all four seasons, showcasing the transformation of this extraordinary place over the decades. After the screening, there will be a meet and greet with Ljasuk Dimitry, the film's protagonist.

The director and writer of the film is Szendőfi Balázs, who captures the awe-inspiring beauty of the Tisza Lake through his lens. The cinematographers include Fehér Zoltán, Ljasuk Dimitry, and Szendőfi Balázs, while the editing and music composition were also done by Szendőfi Balázs. The film was produced by Petényi Mirkó, Sárga Nóra, Pató Viktória, Szendőfi Balázs, Ljasuk Dimitry, and Fehér Zoltán.

Don't miss the opportunity to immerse yourself in the mesmerizing world of the Tisza Lake. Join us on Friday, October 6, 2023, at 8:30 PM UTC+02 for this captivating nature film. Tickets are available at [muveszmozi.hu](https://muveszmozi.hu/.../tisza-az-ember-alkotta-paradicsom) and you can watch the trailer [here](https://youtu.be/J_7ScZYULdA).
