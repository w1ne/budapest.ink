 ### Oleksandr Zaitsev: Dmytro Dontsov's Personal War Against Russia

### Oleksandr Zaitsev: Dmytro Dontsov's Personal War Against Russia

Join us on **Wednesday, May 22, 2024, at 12:30 PM CEST** as we delve into the intriguing topic of **"Dmytro Dontsov's Personal War Against Russia"** with Oleksandr Zaitsev. Hosted by the Institute for Advanced Study at CEU, this event promises to be a thought-provoking exploration of Dontsov's ideology and his relentless battle against Russian influence.

Dmytro Dontsov, a prominent figure in Ukrainian integral nationalism, dedicated his life to challenging Russian imperialism in its many forms. From Tsarist Russia to the Communist regime and even the modern-day "liberal" era, Dontsov vehemently opposed Russia's expansionist tendencies. His views, once seen as extreme, are now gaining relevance in today's geopolitical landscape.

During this event, we will analyze Dontsov's strategies for countering Russia, dissecting his successes and failures. As the Russian Federation continues its aggression against Ukraine, Dontsov's ideas take on a new significance, extending beyond academia into real-world implications.

To secure your spot at this enlightening discussion, RSVP to Agnes Bendik at bendkag@ceu.edu. Don't miss this opportunity to gain valuable insights into a crucial aspect of Ukrainian history and its ongoing relevance today. See you there!
