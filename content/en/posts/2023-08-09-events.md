 ### Ripoff Raskolnikov Band  km. Petendi Tam√°s// 08.09 // KOBUCI KERT

**Event Announcement: Ripoff Raskolnikov Band at Kobuci Kert**

Join us for a special evening of blues and celebration as Ripoff Raskolnikov and his band take the stage at Kobuci Kert. Not only will we be treated to an incredible performance by this legendary bluesman, but we will also be commemorating his 68th birthday on August 9, 2023. This promises to be a unique and unforgettable event.

Ripoff Raskolnikov is a seasoned street musician who has traveled across European countries, enchanting audiences with his music. His early influences were rooted in European folk music, but he gradually embraced the Americana style, drawing inspiration from iconic figures such as Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, and the Rolling Stones.

In Hungary, Ripoff Raskolnikov first captivated audiences with his iconic stage presence in November 1987. Since then, he has continued to perform countless concerts, and Hungary has become one of his homes. In 2019, he released an album titled "Small World," featuring songs that explore the spectrum of human emotions, including love, travel, daily struggles, passion, loss, aspiration, and vitality.

In 2021, Ripoff Raskolnikov will bless us with a new double live album, showcasing his musical prowess and captivating performances. The Ripoff Raskolnikov Band is known for being among the most exceptional representatives of the Americana style, which blends elements of blues, folk, and singer-songwriter genres in a unique and personal way. Think Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, and Steve Earle.

Raskolnikov is a wordsmith who has been living in Hungary for almost 20 years, impressing both locals and expatriates with his sophisticated vocabulary and songwriting skills that rival those of the mentioned gentlemen. His albums have been receiving increasingly positive reviews overseas, earning him a reputation as a highly talented and influential artist.

Accompanied by his group of exceptional session musicians, Ripoff Raskolnikov regularly performs in the region and represented Hungary at the European Blues Challenge in 2022. This serves as a testament to his passion and dedication to delivering outstanding music to his audiences.

Don't miss this opportunity to witness the musical mastery of Ripoff Raskolnikov and his band. Come celebrate his birthday and experience an unforgettable evening of mesmerizing blues at Kobuci Kert. Get your tickets now at [kobuci.hu](https://kobuci.hu/programok/ripoff_raskolnikov_band_1317/).

 ### Haj√≥gy√°r kertkoncertek a PIM-ben - Balla-Cz.K. (Platon Karataev du√≥)

Haj√≥gy√°r Garden Concerts at PIM - Balla-Cz.K. (Platon Karataev Duo)

The Pet≈ëfi Literary Museum has a long tradition of hosting summer programs, and this year is no exception. In partnership with Haj√≥gy√°r, we are organizing a series of high-quality concerts that promise to be truly special in terms of the venue and the performers. This summer, on four occasions, the museum courtyard and the newly created, impressive space in the K√°rolyi Garden will be filled with lively melodies.

In August, we will be moving towards a more lyrical direction, as we have invited Balla Gerg≈ë and Cz. K. Seb≈ë, the duo behind Platon Karataev, for an intimate garden concert. Platon Karataev, named after Leo Tolstoy's character, made a name for themselves in the Hungarian underground scene with their performance at the Kikeltet≈ë music talent show in 2016. Over the years, the band has delighted audiences with three full-length albums, with their third and first Hungarian-language album titled "Part√©rt ki√°lt√≥" revealing a new, experimental and psychedelic side of their music. However, on August 9th, the duo of Balla Gerg≈ë and Cz. K. Seb≈ë will perform acoustic renditions of their spiritually infused songs accompanied by an acoustic guitar.

Come and be a part of the vibrant cultural life of the museum! The event will take place in the PIM garden and admission is free!
