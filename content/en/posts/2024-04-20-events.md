 ### (BE)COMING SPRING:  body of the garden

### (BE)COMING SPRING: body of the garden

#### Date and Time:
- Saturday, April 20, 2024 at 4:00 PM – 5:30 PM CEST

#### Location:
- Online event

#### Organizer:
- Auróra

Welcome back to the next Seasonal Workshop/Performance Series! Are you ready to embrace the (be)coming spring and delve into the sensory experience of the garden? Join us on a journey through somatic awareness as we explore the transition from the darkness of winter to the light of a new season.

Picture this - a 5-day workshop to prepare ourselves for the spring, where each Saturday from March 30 to April 27, we will nurture the seeds planted during winter. It's a time to let go, to release tensions, and to allow ourselves to simply be as we emerge from the deep earth into the blossoming garden.

In this unique blend of workshop and performance, we will question what it means to work, create, and be seen. How does witnessing change the essence of our actions? Who are we truly performing for if not for ourselves? Let's explore these deep questions together and uncover new layers of self-expression.

As we step into the garden, whether as newcomers or frequent visitors, we'll be challenged to sense, feel, and interact with the space on a profound level. How does the garden speak to you? What language does your body understand? Let go of expectations, embrace the unknown, and open yourself to the subtle messages of the body of the garden.

Led by Christianna Strbik Giaume, a somatic earth movement guide and yoga instructor, this workshop encourages us to connect with nature's elements, share our intentions, and tune into our bodies in a contemplative dance practice. Dress comfortably, as we invite you to move, explore, and discover in a space that bridges the gap between humanity and the natural world.

As we navigate this forest-like environment, remember to tread lightly, stay on the path, and respect the delicate balance of the growing ecosystem around you. Take in the sights, sounds, and sensations of the garden as we harmonize our beings with the nature that surrounds us.

Join us on this transformative journey of self-discovery and connection with the (be)coming spring. Let's watch our steps, listen to the whispers of the garden, and embrace the beauty of (BE)COMING SPRING: body of the garden.

### WATCH YOUR STEP

Unleashing your senses and connecting with nature in a unique workshop/performance experience awaits you. Let's step into the unknown together and discover what lies beneath the surface of the garden. See you there!
