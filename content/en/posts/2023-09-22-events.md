 ### A NAGY AKKUGYÁR-VITA | Ceglédi Zoltán, Várkonyi Gábor, Ungár Péter és Hortay Olivér a Brain Baron

Date: Friday, September 22, 2023
Time: 3:15 PM – 3:55 PM (UTC+02)
Location: Városliget, Budapest
Organizer: Brain Bar

On September 22, join the Brain Bar for Hungary's first public battery factory debate. Over the past few months, the Hungarian media has presented both optimistic and ominous analyses and opinions regarding the construction of battery factories in the country. Undoubtedly, these investments are among the largest in Hungary's history, but are they truly the keys to the nation's prosperity, or do they lay the foundation for economic dependency?

The debate will focus on the benefits that these factories could bring to the cities in which they are located. Will they create job opportunities and drive local economic growth? Additionally, there have been discussions about the presence of foreign guest workers in these factories, but what role will there be for intelligent and talented Hungarian labor?

The event will take place at the Magyar Zene Háza, where experts and panelists will discuss not only the economic impact of these facilities but also the extent to which Hungary's water resources can support them and what solutions can be developed to ensure sufficient energy production for their long-term operation.

The esteemed participants of the debate are as follows:

- Ceglédi Zoltán: Political analyst, columnist, and humorist
- Várkonyi Gábor: Automotive market expert
- Ungár Péter: Leader of the LMP parliamentary group
- Hortay Olivér: Head of the Energy and Climate Policy Division at Századvég.

Don't miss the opportunity to attend this thought-provoking debate at the Brain Bar, Europe's largest future festival for students and teachers. To register, visit: [link to registration]
