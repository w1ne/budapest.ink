 ### 38. Budapest Mineral Show

The 38th Budapest Mineral Show is set to take place at the Hungarian Railway Museum from August 25th to August 27th. This event is the largest mineral fair in the country, showcasing the treasures of the earth's depths including minerals, rocks, fossils, and decorative objects and jewelry made from these materials. With over 200 exhibitors, there is something for everyone, whether you're looking for inexpensive "pebbles" or valuable gemstones.

The Budapest Mineral Show offers more than just a shopping experience. It is also an opportunity for learning and entertainment. Many of the exhibitors sell specimens that they have collected themselves and are happy to share the adventurous stories of their findings. Local mineral museums will also bring and showcase their latest acquisitions. Under the guidance of Dr. Ferenc Hollósy, visitors can learn about the fluorescence of minerals - how they change color under certain light conditions. Attendees can also gather information about participating in mineral collecting tours in Hungary, as well as purchase the necessary tools and literature.

The event features various interactive games and activities, with the Kőkaszinó lucky wheel and gemstone panning being the highlights each year. Through these games, visitors can get closer to the world of nature's treasures, minerals, and rocks. For those who have had their fill of minerals and other gems, the Park offers a chance to ride a small train, admire old locomotives and carriages, and enjoy a satisfying meal at the charming restaurant with specially prepared menus for the event.

The Budapest Mineral Show is open every day from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. We warmly welcome you to the fair! How would you like to explore the largest mineral collection in the country with us? If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us.
