 ### Kuba Szreder: Duckrabbits unveiled. A sneak peek into the postartistic theory and practice (lecture)

### Kuba Szreder: Duckrabbits Unveiled - A Fascinating Dive into Postartistic Theory and Practice

Join us for an intriguing exploration into the world of postartistic theory and practice with Kuba Szreder as he unveils the enigmatic realm of duckrabbits. This unique lecture delves into the concept of duckrabbits, cryptic creatures residing at the intersection of art and everyday life. The Consortium of Postartistic Practices, a network of postartists, conceptualists, activists, and academics, has even adopted duckrabbits on their coat of arms due to their multifaceted nature.

Just as duckrabbits can be perceived in multiple ways, the activities of postartists can blur the lines between art and non-art, challenging traditional boundaries. The emergence of postart in Poland has led to a wave of hybrid activities that blend art with anti-authoritarianism, activism, research, feminism, and ecological awareness. Postartists like Szreder bring art into the fabric of everyday life, redefining the notion of creativity and expression.

Kuba Szreder, a lecturer and curator at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, will guide us through this captivating journey into the world of postart. With his extensive experience in curatorial practice and research, Szreder offers a fresh perspective on contemporary art and its societal implications. His work has spanned across various projects, publications, and collaborations, both locally and internationally.

Save the Date: **October 31, 2024, at 18:00**  
Location: **Intermedia Department, Auditorium, Budapest**  
Address: **Kmety Gy√∂rgy u. 27, 1063 Hungary**

Don't miss this unique opportunity to uncover the hidden layers of postart and delve into the realm of duckrabbits with Kuba Szreder. Stay tuned for more updates and insights into this thought-provoking lecture.
