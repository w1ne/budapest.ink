Hey there!

Are you a fan of history, culture, and community? Well, mark your calendars for **April 18th** and head over to **Pollack Mih√°ly t√©r** for a cause that's worth standing up for ‚Äì the preservation of the historic buildings of Hungarian Radio!

The Magyar R√°di√≥ buildings currently face the threat of demolition due to the construction plans for the new P√°zm√°ny Campus. Not only is this project proceeding without consulting the local residents, but it also risks erasing a piece of our shared history. The very building where the first armed skirmish of the '56 revolution broke out and where prominent Hungarian artists find creative sanctuaries ‚Äì all at risk.

It's time to take a stand and protect the historical studios of Magyar R√°di√≥ from destruction. Let's show that our history and community values matter! Join us for an evening filled with performances by talented artists like Bal√≥ Istv√°n, D√©nes √Åbel, Galaxisok, More von dir, Mayberian Sansk√ºlotts, and Sallai L√°szl√≥.

If you'd like to support the event and contribute to covering the costs, you can do so [here](https://tamogass.ahang.hu/palotanegyed). And if you believe in the cause and want to add your voice to the 6000 signatures already collected, you can sign the petition [here](szabad.ahang.hu/p/cape).

Let's come together to protect our heritage, celebrate our culture, and show that when we stand united, we can make a difference! Don't miss out on this opportunity to be a part of something meaningful and impactful. See you there!

 ### My Planet | Personal Development Workshop by Andreas Krivas

## My Planet | Personal Development Workshop by Andreas Krivas

### Date and Time
Thursday, April 18, 2024 at 7:00 PM CEST

### Location
To be announced

### Organizer
ANT Collective

The ANT Collective is thrilled to present "My Planet," a unique personal development Art Therapy Workshop led by the extraordinary Andreas Krivas from Greece. This workshop, scheduled for Thursday, April 18, 2024, at 7:00 PM CEST, aims to take participants on a journey of self-exploration by delving into the concept of creating their own planet.

Andreas Krivas, a creative thinker, observer, artist, art therapist, and self-proclaimed "sometimes alien," will guide attendees in a safe and welcoming environment as they embark on this transformative experience. The workshop is a space for individuals to construct their own planet, their own shelter, where they can express themselves freely and authentically.

In his own words, Andreas shares the inspiration behind this workshop, "For quite some time I‚Äôve been thinking to create my own planet. I imagine it. It will be my lodge; my shelter. I‚Äôll move there. And whenever and if I feel like it, I‚Äôll be visiting the planet where all of us, people, live together. I observed that I think of my planet more intensely when I get disappointed in people and don‚Äôt dare to tell anyone. I feel trembling with fear when a man kills a woman, and I want to scream when a child gets tortured. No one will enter my planet unless I say so. No one will enter if they don‚Äôt meet the requirement."

This workshop offers a one-of-a-kind opportunity to tap into your creativity, explore personal growth, and connect with others in a meaningful way. Participation requires only a voluntary donation, making it accessible to all who are seeking to embark on this introspective journey.

Don't miss out on this chance to be part of "My Planet" and discover new aspects of yourself in a supportive and inclusive setting. Stay tuned for further details on the workshop's location and get ready to embark on a unique exploration of personal development with Andreas Krivas and the ANT Collective.
