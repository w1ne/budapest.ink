 ### TELT HÁZ - Jöjj és lásd!

**TELT HÁZ - Jöjj és lásd!**

Are you a fan of Soviet films? If so, you're in for a treat! Bem Mozi is organizing a screening of the film "JÖJJ ÉS LÁSD!" on Tuesday, September 12, 2023, from 8:15 PM to 10:45 PM UTC+02. The event will take place at the coordinates 47.514696, 19.036163.

"JÖJJ ÉS LÁSD!" is a 1985 Soviet film directed by Elem Klimov. The movie tells the story of a young peasant boy named Flera who finds a rifle and joins the partisans in the midst of World War II. Assigned to the logistics unit by the commander, the youngest soldiers end up facing unimaginable hardships.

This is not a film you can watch twice. It leaves an indelible mark on your memory, especially certain scenes that are unforgettable. It is a war film that should be shown to anyone contemplating war. Its strength lies in portraying the war through the eyes of a child. The suffering of the children is what touches the audience most deeply. Director Elem Klimov demands an unprecedented level of identification with the characters, showing the war without any gloss or shading of evil (which, in this case, refers to the occupying German forces). The movie rawly and cruelly exposes what war is like and what it does to a person, even if that person is just a child (port.hu).

The screening of "JÖJJ ÉS LÁSD!" will begin at 8:15 PM on September 12. Tickets are priced at 1,700 Ft and are available on a first-come, first-served basis. The tickets do not guarantee a specific seat, as seating arrangements will be made upon arrival. The doors will open approximately 5 minutes before the start of the screening.

Please note that all tickets for this event have been sold out! However, if you have reserved tickets and have not yet collected them, they will be available for pickup at the ticket office starting from 7:45 PM. Additionally, there will be another screening of the film in October. Thank you for your understanding.

Don't miss out on this opportunity to witness the power of "JÖJJ ÉS LÁSD!" as it portrays the harsh realities of war through the eyes of a child. Mark your calendars and make sure to be there on September 12 for an evening that will leave a lasting impression.

 ### Vittula Vásár // Szeptember

Join us at Vittula Vásár // Szeptember on Tuesday, September 12, 2023, from 7:00 PM to 11:55 PM at Kertész utca 4, Budapest. This event is organized by Klub Vittula and is held every second Tuesday of the month in the exhibition room of Klub Vittula.

The Vittula Vásár is a unique kind of market where you can bring anything you want to sell or trade. It's not just limited to clothes – you can bring books, CDs, flashlights, homemade cookies, dolls, hairdryers, badges, patches, or even homemade sausages! The best part is that if you come to browse and shop, you have a greater chance of finding something interesting and useful that you didn't even know you needed. It's like a treasure hunt!

The market opens at 6:00 PM, as soon as the vendors set up their stalls. You can start exploring and browsing for hidden gems. Until then, feel free to grab a drink at the Vittu' bar and enjoy an Unicum and beer.

If you're curious about the previous Vittula Vásár events, you can check out the photos and posts on our Facebook page. And if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us at hajduandor@gmail.com. We can't wait to see you on September 12th!

Kisses and high fives from Andor and the Vittu Crew!

 ### AntiBME napok 2023

Dear friends of ELTE,

As the new school year begins, it's time once again for the traditional AntiBME event. This gathering is a celebration of free music, good company, and the start of the semester. 

But what exactly is AntiBME? Well, let me share with you the words of the organizers from four years ago, who summed it up perfectly:

"During this time, it is customary to organize the BME Days, and the sound insulation is usually solved by hanging soundproof garbage bags on the barriers, thereby muffling the sound of the outdoor concert. In other words, we gather at our own university, listen to great music for free, enjoy alcoholic beverages, and in some places, the light of a hookah pipe will shine."

So, with that in mind, we invite you all to join us for a delightful evening of music, drinks, and great vibes. This event will take place on September 12th, starting at 6:00 PM, and will continue until the early hours of September 15th, at Pázmány Péter sétány 1/A, Budapest.

The organizer of this event is Dávid Hegedűs, and he has put together a fantastic lineup of artists for your entertainment. This is the perfect opportunity to kick off the new semester, meet new people, and have a great time.

So mark your calendars and get ready for an unforgettable experience at AntiBME 2023. We look forward to welcoming you with open arms and rocking out together. Remember, admission is completely free!

See you there!

Note: This event announcement has been created based on the provided information. Please refer to the official event page and organizer for any updates or additional details.

Get ready for an exciting event happening on Tuesday, September 12, 2023, at Kazinczy utca 52/b, Budapest. Apu azért iszik, mert te sírsz is organizing this event, and it's going to be an absolute blast!

The event will kick off at 6:30 PM and run until 8:30 PM local time (UTC+02). We've got some fascinating topics lined up for the evening. Ever wondered if the Room 101 eliminates the presence of the supernatural? We'll be exploring that question in a debate between Orwell and Philip K. Dick.

But that's not all! We'll also be diving into the sins of the West as we examine 150 years of sanatorium in Hungarian society. And of course, we can't forget about Lars von Trier and his notorious shenanigans.

The venue for this event is Ellátó, located at Kazinczy utca 52/b. Admission is priced at 1500 Ft., and tickets can only be purchased at the venue itself. Please note that cash is the only accepted form of payment for the tickets (although card payments are accepted at the bar inside).

The planned gate opening time is 17:00, but as always, we reserve the right to make changes if necessary.

So mark your calendars and make sure to join us on September 12th for an evening filled with intriguing discussions, passionate debates, and maybe even a few surprises. This is an event you don't want to miss!

See you there!

 ### SZINYOVA Gergő: Karma

Join us for the opening of SZINYOVA Gergő's exhibition titled "Karma" on Tuesday, September 12, 2023, at 6:00 PM UTC+02. The event will be held at the coordinates 47.489740, 19.060000. The exhibition is organized by Kisterem.

SZINYOVA Gergő, a talented young painter, will be showcasing his latest paintings at Kisterem's autumn opening exhibition. Over the past decade, Gergő has been exploring the complexities of abstract painting. However, in 2020, he made a significant transition towards fully figurative painting. His previous solo exhibition at Kisterem in 2021 already featured these narrative-driven artworks.

During this autumn's exhibition, visitors will have the opportunity to see Gergő's latest works from his ongoing figurative program. These artworks incorporate elements that are familiar from his earlier paintings, as well as his signature technique that resembles various printing processes. Through his artwork, Gergő raises thought-provoking questions about the infinite reproduction of images.

The exhibition will be open to the public starting from September 13, 2023, until October 13, 2023. Don't miss this chance to experience the unique artistry of SZINYOVA Gergő and delve into the world of his thought-provoking paintings.

Come and join us for an evening of art and creativity at the opening of "Karma" by SZINYOVA Gergő. We look forward to seeing you there!
