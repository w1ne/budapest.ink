This event will showcase the quint (fifth) as the protagonist in J√°nos's compositions, taking on different roles from limits to duplications.

The compositions' forms are solid yet not fixed in sheet music; rather, they are captured through algorithms. Live recordings will be used exclusively during the performance, undergoing various transformations controlled by the artist using a mobile phone in real-time.

Additionally, adaptations of significant classical pieces for a single instrument will be explored, drawing a fascinating line from Renaissance diminutions to the 19th-century 'little hands' series up to Cage's 'Cheap imitation'. These diverse functions, musical styles, and social contexts pave the way for the birth of a new genre or perhaps challenge the sanctity of classical music.
