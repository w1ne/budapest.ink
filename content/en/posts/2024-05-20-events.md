 ### Margit Island Convent Ruin meeting

# Margit Island Convent Ruin Meeting

**Date:** Monday, May 20, 2024  
**Time:** 6:30 PM CEST  
**Location:** Budapest, Margitsziget, Budapest, Hungary  
**Organizer:** Budapest Toastmasters

Explore the historical charm of Budapest by joining us for a unique meeting at the Margit Island Convent Ruins on Monday, May 20th. Step back in time to the 13th century and experience the ambiance of a religious and administrative center that once stood as a Dominican convent and royal mansion. Imagine the echoes of speeches from centuries past as we gather to showcase our speaking skills in this historic setting.

Getting to the ruins is an adventure in itself! From the 4/6 tram stop, you have a couple of options. Walk through the center of the island to reach the ruins, where the stage awaits on the right side closest to the river. Alternatively, follow the running path along the Pest-facing side of the island until you spot the metal platform on your left. After crossing and turning left, you'll find yourself at the Medieval Dominican Convent and Royal Mansion, also known as Középkori domonkosrendi kolostor és királyi udvarház.

Embrace technology during this paperless event as we use our devices for voting and feedback. Following the meeting, don't miss out on the enchanting musical fountain show. While the "seats" are of stone, worry not! Cardboard will be provided for seating, though feel free to bring a cushion for extra comfort. Adding to the experience, you're welcome to bring snacks, drinks, and even a friend along for the evening.

Let's make history at the Margit Island Convent Ruin Meeting and show that our present-day speeches can captivate just as effectively as those from centuries gone by. Mark your calendars and prepare to shine on this memorable evening in Budapest! 💫✨
