Visitors will have the opportunity to explore Fehér's captivating artworks that delve into the complexities of memory and the human experience.

Q Contemporary gratefully acknowledges Opera Gin as a supporter of the exhibition. The partnership with Opera Gin adds an additional element of elegance and sophistication to the event.

You will learn how to pair different Japanese gins with tonic water to create the most delicious results. In fact, you will even have the opportunity to make your own gin and tonic using three different gins.

No Japanese gin tasting would be complete without authentic Japanese food, and that's why we will be serving sushi alongside the gin sampling. Don't worry if you're not familiar with chopsticks – we'll be there to help!

In addition to exploring the world of Japanese gin, we will also delve into the secrets of selecting the best gin spices and learn a bit about the history of gin through interactive tastings.

Plus, you'll gain lifelong knowledge about gin and have the chance to meet fellow gin enthusiasts and make new friends.

After the workshop, you can continue the evening at the exclusive gin and tonic bar, where you can choose from 300 different gins. It's a gin lover's paradise!

Here are the star Japanese gins that will be featured in the tasting:

- Roku gin: This gin uses six different Japanese spices to evoke the flavors of all four seasons.

- Hanami dry gin
- Kinotea Kyoto gin (with green tea): This gin combines the delicate sweetness of Japanese green tea with the botanical notes of gin. Will you be able to taste the tea's subtle sweetness?

 ### Gólyahajó// Freshmen's Boat 2023 

Are you ready for a night of excitement and fun? Get ready for Gólyahajó// Freshmen's Boat 2023! On Thursday, September 28, 2023, at 8:00 PM UTC+02, head down to Batthyány tér in Budapest. This event is organized by IÖCS, and it promises to be an unforgettable night.

If you've been missing the IÖCS, the DJs, your favorite instructors, and partying until sunrise, then this event is perfect for you. The theme for the night is the 50s America, inspired by the iconic movie Grease. So, bring out your hair gels, leather jackets, red lipsticks, and skirts, and get ready to step into the colorful world of Grease.

Instead of a car race, you'll be treated to a 1.5-hour night cruise (wink, wink). The IÖCS DJs will be there to set the mood and keep the party going. And if you think you've got what it takes, you can showcase your singing skills or at least your lyrical knowledge with some karaoke.

But this event isn't just about the party; there's also a little puzzle for you to solve. Work together with your friends to solve the riddle and win valuable prizes.

To make the Freshmen's Boat complete, we need you to participate in the event in costume. Dress up as Pink Ladies, T Birds, or Sandys and add some flair to the evening.

Ticket prices will be announced soon, so stay tuned for updates. Please note that this event is exclusively for freshmen and instructors.

So, gather your friends, put on your dancing shoes, and get ready to have an amazing night at Gólyahajó// Freshmen's Boat 2023. Remember, "You're the one that I want"!

 ### TÁP // A szexualitás története

Join us for an evening of exploration and discussion as we delve into the history of human sexuality in the performance theater piece titled "TÁP // A szexualitás története." Led by the talented team from TÁP Tilos az Á Performansz Színház, this thought-provoking performance will take place on Thursday, September 28, 2023, from 9:00 PM to 10:30 PM UTC+02 at Jurányi Street 1-3 in Budapest.

In this performance, the machine vibrates everywhere - wherever you look, wherever you hide, wherever you reach. It lingers in your workplace, whips in the offices and bureaucrats' shredders. It clenches its fist while tied to the bed. It lurks in the empty spaces between the gears of the market giant factory, in deserted malls, under children's beds, in soldiers' trousers. Its wires run through your body, buzzing and whispering in your flesh, labeling you as fat, lascivious, perverted, hysterical! At other times, it caresses you in the classroom, in the basement, on the night beach, and on the backseat of your car.

The machine permeates the body. It hums, moans, speaks. It writes on the skin. It tells the story of sexuality.

The performance features a talented cast including Szabó Veronika, Sárközi-Nagy Ilona, Lestyán Attila, Martinkovics Máté, and Medveczky Balázs. The script is written by Lénárd Róbert-Selmeczi Bea, with dramaturgy by Selmeczi Bea. The music is composed by Zságer-Varga Ákos, costumes designed by Jákóhalmi Zsófia, and set design by Boros Anna Eszter. The production is led by produkciós vezetőDézsi Fruzsina with the assistance of Csonka Laura, and directed by Lénárd Róbert.

The performance will take place at B staircase, 2nd floor, TÁP room in the Jurányi Ház. This event is supported by the Ministry of Human Resources.

Don't miss this opportunity to delve into the fascinating history of human sexuality through the unique lens of performance theater. Join us for an evening of thought-provoking exploration and immersive storytelling. Grab your tickets now and be a part of this unforgettable experience.
