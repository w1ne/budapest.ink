If you're not familiar with the handpan, it is a term used to encompass a variety of steel instruments that are handcrafted and produce UFO-like sounds. The handpan was first introduced in 2000 by Sabina Scharer and Felix Rohner, known as the creators of the PanArt Hang. Since then, the handpan has gained popularity worldwide, with new makers constantly emerging. Its ethereal sound resonates with people of all ages, nationalities, and backgrounds. It's no wonder that more and more people are not only drawn to listening to the handpan but also eager to learn how to play it.

The origins of the handpan can be traced back to the steel pan, also known as the steel drum. During World War II, the American and British armies left thousands of oil barrels in Trinidad, which local musicians then transformed into rhythm instruments through skillful blacksmithing. The handpan incorporates the spirit of the steel pan, as well as elements from the ghatam, udu, ghamelan, and gong.

Manaman is an ambassador for the Hungarian MAG Instruments handpan and is available to answer any questions you may have about the instrument or assist you in purchasing a MAG Instruments handpan.

So, get ready to be enchanted by the mesmerizing combination of film and live handpan music at the Atlantisz (R. Luc Besson) Film Élő Handpan Zenével A Bem Moziban event in Budapest. Don't miss out on this unique sensory experience!

 ### „Szeretnék kibékülni ezzel a zsenivel…” - Márai Sándor Petőfi Sándorról - Márai-estek

Title: "An Evening with Márai Sándor: Understanding his Relationship with Petőfi Sándor"

Are you a fan of Hungarian literature? Do you want to dive into the complex relationship between two literary giants? Then mark your calendars for the event "Szeretnék kibékülni ezzel a zsenivel…" - Márai Sándor Petőfi Sándorról - Márai-estek, happening on Monday, September 18, 2023, at 7:00 PM UTC+02 at the Várkert Bazár in Budapest.

Hosted by the Várkert Bazár, this event will bring together Hirtling István, a talented actor, and Mészáros Tibor, an esteemed literary historian and Márai researcher. Their evenings exploring Márai's works are more than just reciting excerpts; they delve into exciting, unique, and lesser-known information about this timeless author. The presentations will be accompanied by projected images, documents, and the inspirational and diverse musical accompaniment of Tárkány-Kovács Bálint, a Junior Príma Award-winning cimbalom artist. This immersive experience aims to deepen the audience's appreciation and understanding of Márai's literary texts.

Márai Sándor's relationship with Petőfi Sándor, another celebrated Hungarian writer, was both contradictory and fascinating. Throughout his entire body of work, Márai acknowledged Petőfi's genius and spoke glowingly of his works. However, he also criticized Petőfi's mischievous nature and restless character, as well as the role that the domestic cultural policy assigned to him during his time in exile. This evening event will provide insight into this multifaceted relationship, giving voice to Márai's admiring and critical perspectives.

Don't miss the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of Márai's literary legacy and his complex relationship with Petőfi Sándor. Join Mészáros Tibor, Hirtling István, and Tárkány-Kovács Bálint at the Várkert Bazár on September 18, 2023. This event is sponsored by the Szerencsejáték Zrt., as part of the Petőfi200 memorial year.
