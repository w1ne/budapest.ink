 ### ALGIERS, Aviary // A38 Haj√≥

ALGIERS, Aviary // A38 Haj√≥

Get ready for an unforgettable night of music as Algiers makes their return to A38 Haj√≥ in Budapest. Known for their committed gospel-punk sound, Algiers combines powerful social themes with pulsating rave-punk anthems and soulful blues-gospel songs. They have built a cult following and have become one of the most exciting bands in recent years. Don't miss the opportunity to experience their electrifying performance live on stage.

Joining Algiers is AVIARY, a band that has been making waves in the Hungarian post-punk/post-wave scene. They gained attention in the 2021 KIKELTET≈ê talent competition, where they made it into the top 8 performers. With their dark atmospheres and guitar-driven electronic sound, AVIARY has been making a name for themselves on the underground festival and club circuit.

Algiers' fourth album, SHOOK, is a testament to their ability to bring together diverse voices and styles. Featuring a lineup of guest artists ranging from icons to up-and-coming stars, SHOOK is a collection of 17 mind-expanding and thrilling tracks. It reflects the band's exploration of different genres and influences, creating a unique and captivating sonic experience.

The album was born out of a much-needed break from the pressures of the music industry. During this time, the members of Algiers immersed themselves in music production, honing their skills as beatmakers and producers. They drew inspiration from a range of artists, from DJ Grand Wizard Theodore to contemporary rap and punk icons. The result is a fusion of urban and counter-culture styles that push the boundaries and redefine what it means to be shook in the modern world.

SHOOK is a collaborative effort, with each guest artist bringing their own perspective and voice to the album. From the fiery verses of Zack de la Rocha on "Irreversible Damage" to the poignant spoken monologue by Boy Harsher's Jae Matthews on "I Can't Stand It," each track is a testament to the power of collective artistry. The album also pays homage to Atlanta, the band's hometown, with field recordings and samples that evoke the sensory experience of growing up in the urban South.

Despite facing internal conflicts and the threat of breaking up, Algiers has managed to create a record that is both transformative and deeply personal. It is a celebration of their roots and a rediscovery of their relationship with the city they call home. Don't miss your chance to witness Algiers and AVIARY in concert at A38 Haj√≥. It promises to be a night of exhilarating music and unforgettable performances.
