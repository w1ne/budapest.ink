 ### Leitner Levente - Waterworld

Are you ready to dive into a unique and immersive art experience? Join us for the Leitner Levente - Waterworld exhibition, taking place on Monday, September 11, 2023, at 7:00 PM UTC+02. The event will be held at Falk Miksa utca 13 in Budapest, organized by Nagyházi Contemporary.

The Waterworld exhibition curated by Tímea Fülöp invites you to explore the intersection of Eastern comfort and Western demands. Levente Leitner's artworks are infused with both sacred and profane elements, creating a truly captivating experience. 

Drawing inspiration from literary and mythological references, Leitner skillfully weaves together narratives and symbols to evoke a sense of interconnectedness between water, cleansing, and spirituality. Like Pilate washing his hands or the biblical story of the flood cleansing mankind of shared sins, Waterworld delves into the themes of purification and absolution.

Through Leitner's artistic lens, the exhibition contemplates themes such as youth, beauty, and the quest for eternal life. The search for the fountain of youth in Baden, pursued by the Swiss, becomes an elusive endeavor akin to Tantalus reaching for the waves. The exhibition also explores the significance of water in various cultural contexts, from the Avernus's sulfurous scent in the Underworld, loved by thermal spa enthusiasts, to the emergence of Venus from the Mediterranean Sea, symbolizing liberation and sensuality.

One of the highlights of the Waterworld exhibition is Levente's thorn-crowned jacuzzi, where the swirling waters part at the touch of Moses. Another thought-provoking piece portrays Jesus himself washing the feet of Odysseus instead of a nanny. These imagery-rich compositions invite viewers to reflect on themes of redemption, self-reflection, and the human experience.

In Leitner Levente's Waterworld, the bathwater becomes a cradle and a blindfold, and even the stoic philosopher Seneca shows remorse while sitting in a bathtub. The exhibition offers a contemplative space, encouraging visitors to engage with the artworks on a personal and introspective level.

Don't miss the opportunity to immerse yourself in the thought-provoking world of Leitner Levente - Waterworld. Join us on Monday, September 11, at 7:00 PM UTC+02 at Falk Miksa utca 13 in Budapest for an unforgettable and spiritually-infused art experience.
