Attention all Roma culture enthusiasts! Get ready for a day filled with art, music, and celebration as Eötvös10 presents the Roma Day event on Saturday, August 5th, 2023. Due to inclement weather conditions, the event will now be held at Eötvös10 instead of Hunyadi tér.

The festivities kick off at 3:00 PM with the opening of the Roma Heroes exhibition. Curated by the Independent Theatre of Hungary, the exhibition showcases the diverse stories, perspectives, and characters of Roma theaters and creators. Visitors can explore captivating portrait photographs of the artists and the dramatic characters they bring to life, representing a range of countries from Ireland to Bulgaria and Spain to Romania. Through quotes and recordings, visitors will gain insight into the perspectives, stories, values, and challenges of Roma theatrical creators, actors, and the characters they portray. The exhibition aims to shed light on the often overlooked treasures of Roma theater and the challenges faced by European Roma communities, serving as inspiration for both community members and the wider society. This exhibition has been developed as part of the Roma Heroes Festivals, the world's only international Roma theater gathering. It will be on display until September 1st.

In addition to the exhibition, there will be various activities throughout the day. From 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM, join the arts and crafts workshop for a hands-on experience. At 3:30 PM, the Independent Theatre of Hungary's community theater group, Büfé, will perform "Elvont dolgok áruháza," an interactive theatrical production exploring the absurd things people are willing to offer in order to fulfill their desires. The performance features a range of characters, including a teacher desperate for respect from students and a singleton willing to buy a girlfriend. This thought-provoking performance is sure to leave a lasting impact.

At 4:00 PM, Romano Glaszo will lead a workshop on teaching Hungarian and Roma children's songs. Participants will receive song lyrics on paper and learn three songs: "Mikor kicsi gyerek voltam" (When I Was a Little Child), "Akkor szép az erdő" (Then the Forest is Beautiful), and a unique adaptation of "Csiga biga gyere ki" (Come Out, Snail). The workshop promises to be a fun and easy way to learn these traditional tunes.

At 4:30 PM, Romano Glaszo will take to the stage for a concert featuring Hungarian, Roma, and Spanish music, including flamenco and Balkan folk songs. The band's leader will also provide informative insights into Roma history and culture throughout the performance.

To cap off the evening, head to Hunyadi kertmozi at 9:00 PM for a screening of "Cigányok ideje" (Time of the Gypsies). Directed by Emir Kusturica, this Yugoslav-Italian-British film from 1988 is predominantly in the Romani language. The film centers around the lives of impoverished Roma in the outskirts of Sarajevo who turn to foreign labor as a means of survival. One of the main characters, Ahmed, the leader of a Roma mafia in Italy, promises money and assistance to Perhan, a young boy with mystical powers, if he joins him. However, Perhan soon realizes he has been exploited in a world where begging, burglary, and prostitution are means of survival, and it may be too late for him to escape. The film features an iconic musical score by renowned composer Goran Bregović, known for his work in other Kusturica films such as "Underground" and "Arizona Dream." "Time of the Gypsies" won the Best Director award at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival.

Please note that the schedule is subject to change. In case of rain, the event will be held at Eötvös10.

Also performing on August 5th is Papp Sándor, a finalist in the 1990 Paris Guitar Competition, who regularly gives concerts and holds courses both in Hungary and abroad. He has performed all over the world, from Australia to Europe and Mexico. Since 2019, he has been the director of the Bartók Béla Institute of Music at the University of Miskolc.

These artists, coming from seemingly different worlds, complement each other perfectly. Alongside their own compositions, they perform jazz, blues, and various well-known melodies, occasionally adding their excellent vocal harmonies to the mix.

For those interested in attending the concerts, it is recommended to arrive early to admire the botanical garden before the performances begin. Additionally, there will be a guitar workshop on Saturday morning titled "Stano Pocaji - Fingerstyle Guitar Technique in Jazz Improvisation."
