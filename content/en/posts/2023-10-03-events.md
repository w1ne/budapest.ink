 ### Horváth János Antal: Becsapódás 

Horváth János Antal: Becsapódás is an engaging theatrical production happening on Tuesday, October 3, 2023, at 7:00 PM UTC+02. The event will take place at Marczibányi tér 5/A in Budapest and is organized by LOUPE Színházi Társulás.

The play revolves around two couples who have been meeting every other week for a shared meal for the past ten years. The girls in the group are sisters. This tradition has become both natural and burdensome as time wore on, but they continue to uphold it. However, this particular gathering promises to be different. There is something in the air today, something unique. It is a tense atmosphere that permeates not just the country, but also the characters' lives.

Shortly, notifications start chiming on their phones, and it is announced that the president will address the nation within minutes. What could it be this time? A video message is played in front of a national flag, directed at the people. The country has been attacked. A rocket has struck a border town, claiming the lives of four individuals. The country cannot idly watch its citizens fall unjustly. Action must be taken. This now becomes their war. The immediate recruitment of all eligible men is ordered, and the borders will be sealed in twelve hours. The characters must make quick decisions that will have a lasting impact on their lives. The question is, can they live with their choices? Is it worth living without a homeland? Or is it worth dying for a country that will never truly be theirs? In the end, they might find themselves trapped not just within the confines of the country but also within the room they are in.

The play features talented actors, including Földes Eszter, Lengyel Tamás, Molnár Áron, and Ullmann Mónika. The set design is by Pallós Nelli, costume design by Kisprumik Ádám, and dramaturgy by Balassa Eszter. The music is composed by Hunyadi Máté, with projection design by Karcis Gábor. Perényi Luca assists the director, while the script is written by Horváth János Antal, based on improvisations by the actors. Horváth János Antal also directs the play.

Don't miss the thought-provoking and emotionally charged performance of Horváth János Antal: Becsapódás. It will take you on a journey that delves into the complexities of patriotism, sacrifice, and the limits of personal choices.

What tools are available to citizens, civil society organizations, and local governments? What are the best practices abroad and in Hungary? In our upcoming club meeting, we will explore these questions and seek answers.

 ### MADOKE Kedd Filmklub - Dér Asia: A magunk módjára üvölteni // INGYENES

MADOKE Kedd Filmklub - Dér Asia: A magunk módjára üvölteni // INGYENES

Are you interested in the power of art to incite change? Join us for a screening of the documentary film "Dér Asia: A magunk módjára üvölteni" at the MADOKE Kedd Filmklub. The film explores the life of Hungarian artist Lajos Kassák and his impact on society through his art. It won the Special Prize at the 19th Verzió International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival Hungarian competition program.

In today's world, can art be considered an "Action" that can change public discourse? How much influence can an artist have on society? What does art, community, activism, independence, and success mean to us today? What can an independent creator expect in 21st century Europe if they want to live and create without compromise?

"Dér Asia: A magunk módjára üvölteni" juxtaposes contemporary and historical perspectives, offering a nuanced and thought-provoking portrayal of Kassák's life and his relevance to our time. Kassák's life was intertwined with the major historical events of the 20th century – he lived through both right-wing and left-wing dictatorships, revolutionary times, wars, and even democracy, all while remaining true to his principles as a human being and artist. The film also follows the stories of contemporary Central European artists who, like Kassák, are searching for their place in the world amidst political ideologies.

The screening will be followed by a discussion with the filmmakers. Entrance to the event is free, but registration is required. Please register at: [registration link].

Date: Tuesday, October 3, 2023
Time: 7:00 PM
Location: MáraiKult (1013 Budapest, Krisztina tér 1.)

Please note that photo and video recordings will be taken during the event, and may be used on our website and social media platforms.

Come and explore the power of art and its ability to challenge and inspire change in our society. Don't miss this opportunity to engage in a stimulating discussion about the role of art and activism in the modern world.
