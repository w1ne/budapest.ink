 ### The Creative Eye – We Gain Insight Through Art     

# The Creative Eye – We Gain Insight Through Art

### When and Where?
- **Date:** Saturday, August 17, 2024
- **Time:** 10:00 AM – 1:00 PM CEST
- **Location:** The Ant Collective, 1133 Budapest, Tisza utca 11 (near Dózsa György út metro station)

Do you ever find yourself captivated by the world's artistic expressions? Do you want to unlock your creativity and explore the depths of your imagination? If so, mark your calendars for **Saturday, August 17, 2024**, as The Creative Eye invites you to an immersive art session where we delve into the theme of "The Chimera."

**The Creative Eye** in Budapest is more than just an art gathering; it's a communal journey of self-discovery through artistic expression. As Albert Einstein once said, "Imagination is everything," and this event embodies that sentiment wholeheartedly.

Imagine a morning filled with sketching, painting, and drawing as you observe life around you - models, everyday objects, and fellow participants. The session kicks off with a burst of creativity where you infuse the day's theme and techniques into your artwork. The culmination of the event is a sharing circle, a space where we unravel our impressions and gain insights into each other's perspectives.

At the upcoming gathering, we will delve into the concept of **The Chimera**. What inner monsters and power animals reside within you? Will they breathe fire or sport multiple heads? The term 'chimera' symbolizes a mythical creature crafted from diverse animal parts, embodying a fusion of the fantastic and the grotesque. Through art, we aim to express the chaos within us and sketch our personal chimeras.

The event timeline unfolds as follows:
- **9:45** - Doors open for a warm meet and greet
- **10:00 - 10:30** - Introduction to the session
- **10:30 - 12:30** - Exploration and expression of your inner monsters
- **12:30 - 13:00** - Engage in the sharing circle to discuss your artistic journey

To secure your spot, mark yourself as "going" on the event page and remember to bring HUF 3000 in cash as a contribution fee. Additionally, come prepared with your artistic tools, whether it's pencils, watercolors, acrylics, or inks. Refreshments like tea and water will be available at the venue, and feel free to bring along your favorite snacks to fuel your creativity.

Your host for this artistic escapade is Viktoria, a serene and passionate individual who thrives on exploration and creative expression. Embrace this opportunity to relax, be inspired, and infuse joy into your artistic endeavors with The Creative Eye.

Don't miss out on this opportunity to unleash your creativity and gain new insights through art. Join us on August 17th at The Ant Collective in Budapest, and let your imagination soar amidst a community of like-minded art enthusiasts.
