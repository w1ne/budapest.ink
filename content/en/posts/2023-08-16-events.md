 ### VárKERT Mozi - Kojot négy lelke

Dear audience! The screening of "Kojot négy lelke" at VárKERT Mozi, which was scheduled for August 9, 2023, at 9:00 PM, has been postponed due to unfavorable weather conditions. The event will now take place on August 16, 2023, at 9:00 PM, as a rain date. Your purchased tickets will automatically be valid for the new date.

Location: Várkert Bazár Szárazárok színpad

We invite all film lovers who are looking for some fresh air to join us in the heart of Budapest, at a beautiful and panoramic dog-friendly venue, where we will showcase the best Hungarian films of recent years. Before the screening, we will have a discussion with one of the creators of the film, such as the director, cinematographer, or lead actor. They will provide insights into the making of the film and share stories about the preparation, shooting, and the film's journey. The discussion will start at 8:00 PM.

Guest: Gauder Áron (director)

"Kojot négy lelke" is the latest film from Gauder Áron, the director of "Nyócker!" This feature-length animation retells the Native American creation myth with a focus on the mythical figure of Kojot. Through the myth of the creation of the universe, the film tackles the burning question of how we can live in harmony with our environment before it's too late to save ourselves from destruction.

While we humans believe we are special, we are slowly destroying our surroundings. However, Native Americans understand that humanity is just a small part of the created world. The film addresses our shared responsibility towards each other and the Earth. This magical story, with its circle of life, the adventures of animals and other creatures, magic, hunger, and greed, ultimately offers hope: it's not too late to change and redirect our path even in the eleventh hour.

The Native American culture, closely connected to nature and all living beings, remains largely unexplored in the world of film and animation, and most films do not accurately represent the authentic cultural heritage of Native Americans. Our film aims to bring this rich, magical, and powerful knowledge to the screen in a fresh and innovative way.

Directed by: Gauder Áron
Written by: Bereményi Géza, Gauder Áron
Produced by: Temple Réka
Rain date: August 16.

We hope that this evening will create lasting memories, connecting celebrities with the audience and benefiting the animals at the zoo. The proceeds from this year's charity Retro Party will be used to build the Wombat Castle, providing a larger and more modernized habitat for these adorable Australian marsupials.
