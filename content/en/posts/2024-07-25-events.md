 ### Sunrise Yoga- Asthanga Fundamentals morning session- V√°rosliget & online attendance 

# Sunrise Yoga - Asthanga Fundamentals Morning Session - V√°rosliget & Online Attendance

### Date and Time: Thursday, July 25, 2024 at 7:00 AM ‚Äì 8:00 AM CEST
### Location: 47.511461, 19.087297
### Organizer: Now.We.Flow

Hey there, early risers and yoga enthusiasts! Are you ready to welcome the day with a rejuvenating and energizing yoga practice? Join Now.We.Flow for a Sunrise Yoga session focusing on Asthanga Fundamentals, happening on Thursday morning both outdoors in V√°rosliget and online from the comfort of your own home.

During this session, you will dive into the essence of Asthanga yoga, with a special emphasis on Udday- the art of breathing through the nose. By starting with pranayama techniques to harness the power of breath, you will connect with your inner strength and embrace the present moment. The practice will guide you through deep nose breathing, engaging core muscles, and stretching your body to welcome the new energies of the day.

Whether you're a beginner or seasoned yogi, this class is open to all levels. Experience the flow, rejuvenate your body and mind, and kickstart your morning feeling grateful and relaxed. If you choose to attend in person at V√°rosliget, you'll find us next to Kir√°ly domb, under the soothing shade of trees. After the session, feel free to bask in the morning sun for some extra relaxation.

To secure your spot for the class, simply click "Attending" on the Facebook event page or send an email to nowweflowyoga@gmail.com to receive the Zoom link for online participation. If you're joining in person, drop us an email to let us know you'll be there.

This invigorating yoga experience is donation-based, making it accessible to all. To make the most of your morning practice, it's recommended to start with an empty stomach. However, everyone's body is different, so tailor your pre-practice routine based on your metabolism. For those with low blood sugar, opt for warm drinks and a small protein bar or banana before class, while those with high blood sugar can benefit from early bedtime, savory drinks, and nutritious snacks.

Get ready to flow, breathe, and connect as you greet the day with mindfulness and movement. We'll see you on the mat on Thursday morning at 7 am CET. Namaste! üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüåû
