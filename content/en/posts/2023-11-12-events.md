 ### enJOY vol.2 / Encore! - A holistic dance event

Be welcome to enJOY vol.2 / Encore!, a holistic dance event organized by AGORA. This weekend of embodied joy aims to bring together individuals who are in a process of not knowing, unlearning, and cleansing. Amidst the adversities of our lives, let's take a moment to celebrate the purity of deep connection and explore what we need on a daily basis to maintain a high level of consciousness.

The event is organized by a group of dancers who have a passion for co-creating workshops. They have been attending a teachers' training for Holistic Dance by Sabine Parzer for two years. As a peer group, they have not only experimented with workshop formats amongst themselves but have also opened up spaces for others, blending their diverse backgrounds and personalities.

In February 2023, they held a weekend of workshops in Budapest called "enJOY" and it was a great success. Now, with new friends and experiences on board, they are back with enJOY vol.2. Encore!

The event will feature a series of workshops taking place over the weekend. 

On Saturday morning from 10:00-13:00, participants will have the opportunity to meet with joyful curiosity about being in a new environment. They will explore different ways to resonate with alignment to greatness and delve into what it means to give consent, share, and receive touch on a physical and emotional level. This workshop will draw from Contact Improvisation, bodywork, and deep listening.

In the afternoon, from 14:00-17:00, participants will embark on a journey through their senses. They will interact with different materials and objects, using touch, smell, taste, view, and listening to connect with themselves in a playful and creative way. The workshop will explore and expand the moving patterns known to the body and encourage participants to try something totally new. Creative expression through painting, drawing, writing, performing, and playing is welcome.

On Sunday morning from 10:00-13:00, participants will come together to create a safe and empathic space within themselves and the group. They will explore fun and expressive ways to feel, move, and interact with individuals or the group as a whole. The workshop will flow between (contact) dancing and the role of the sympathetic observer, creating a performative space.

The event registration fee is 60 EUR for the whole weekend or 25 EUR per morning/afternoon session. Registration can be done through the provided link. For more information, participants can contact enjoy.encore2@gmail.com.

The organizers of enJOY vol.2 / Encore! are dancers with a deep passion for movement and exploration. Each of them brings their unique experiences and perspectives to the event. Teresa Kosz, Teresa Kurzbauer, Jonas Lindmaier, Dorka T√≠m√°r, and Bal√°zs Kajor are dedicated to creating spaces that allow individuals to delve into their bodies, connect with themselves, and find joy in the process.

So, if you're looking for a weekend filled with embodied joy and a chance to explore movement, join enJOY vol.2 / Encore! and be a part of this holistic dance event.
