 ### FACES X SICK STEEZ opening night

Join us for the opening night of "Chaos is Control," an interactive installation of faces by Daniel Hedin at Komondors Vintage, located at Wesselényi Utca 21 in Budapest. This one-night-only event, called FACES X SICK STEEZ, is a collaboration of worlds that aims to challenge the idea of identity and self-perception.

The installation invites you to embrace change and question the concept of control. Through the use of faces, Hedin explores how our perception of ourselves can evolve and transform. It is a thought-provoking experience that encourages us to let go of our control and explore the impact this has on our lives.

The night will be dedicated to music and the power it holds. Hosting the event will be the rap collective Sick Steez, known for their improvisation and fluidity in performances. As they lay the foundations from an sp 404, they invite the audience to be a part of their creative journey. This collaboration between the faces and the night promises to be something truly unique and memorable.

We welcome everyone to join us for this special event. Donations will be accepted at the door, and all proceeds will go towards supporting future artistic endeavors.
