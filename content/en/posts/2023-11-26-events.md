 ### Dirty Cash 0006 // (season closing)

Title: Dirty Cash 0006 // Season Closing: The Hottest Queer Party in Budapest

Description:
Get ready for a night of electrifying beats and unforgettable memories at Dirty Cash 0006 // Season Closing, the ultimate queer party in Budapest. Taking place on Saturday, November 25, 2023, at Arzenál club, this event promises to be one for the books. Get ready to relive the magic of the legendary OMOH parties that took place in the same room back in 2020. Don't miss out on the grand finale of the season, as Dirty Cash knows how to throw an incredible party that will leave you wanting more.

The Next Generation Gay Party:
Dirty Cash is not your ordinary party; it's a next-generation gay party that celebrates inclusivity, diversity, and fun. As a queer organization, Dirty Cash stands against any form of harassment, sexism, racism, fat-phobia, homophobia, xenophobia, misogyny, or bigotry. The rules apply to everyone, including "straight-phobia." All genders are welcome and respected, making Dirty Cash a safe and inclusive space for all.

Respect and Consent:
At Dirty Cash, respecting each other and understanding the concept of consent is essential. If someone refuses your approach or says "no," it is crucial to understand and acknowledge their boundaries. Inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated, and individuals engaging in such behavior will be removed from the event and banned from future events. Dirty Cash aims to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable and respected.

Event Details:
The doors of Arzenál club will open at 11:00 PM, and it is recommended to arrive early to avoid crowding. The party will continue until 7:00 AM the next morning, ensuring plenty of time to dance the night away. Tickets can be purchased online, but cash payment is also accepted at the door for those who prefer it. The bar at Arzenál club accepts both cash and card payments for your convenience.

Unveiling the Lineup:
The lineup for Dirty Cash 0006 // Season Closing is a well-kept secret, adding an element of anticipation and surprise to the event. However, you can get a taste of the musical journey that awaits by checking out Dirty Cash's Soundcloud, where you can find live recordings from their previous events. Each event is unique and promises a diverse range of beats that will keep you moving all night long.

Capture the Moment:
While Dirty Cash encourages you to live in the moment and enjoy the party, photography is not strictly forbidden. However, organizers ask that you respect the atmosphere and focus on immersing yourself in the experience rather than constantly documenting it. So put your phone down and allow yourself to fully embrace the energy of the night.

Your Safety Matters:
Dirty Cash prioritizes your safety and reserves the right to deny entry to anyone considered a danger to themselves or others. If you ever feel unsafe or have any concerns throughout the night, the staff members are there to assist you. You can also get in touch via Instagram (@dirtycashbudapest) or send a Facebook message for prompt assistance. Dirty Cash wants you to have an incredible time while ensuring your well-being.

Join the Fun:
Don't miss out on the opportunity to be a part of Dirty Cash's epic season closing event. Get your tickets, gather your friends, and prepare for a night filled with non-stop dancing, infectious energy, and unforgettable memories. See you on the dancefloor!
