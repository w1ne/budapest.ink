 ### Bring√°s uzsonna üö¥ √únnepelj√ºk meg egy√ºtt a v√©dett ker√©kp√°rs√°vok elk√©sz√ºlt√©t

Join us for a bicycle picnic to celebrate the completion of Budapest's first protected bicycle lanes! In the past, it was only possible to cycle safely in certain sections of the city's downtown area. But thanks to the newly implemented protected bicycle lanes along √úll≈ëi √∫t and V√°ci √∫t, that has all changed. Now, you can easily and safely navigate your way to shops, offices, universities, museums, bus and train stations along these routes, separated from the motor vehicles by physical elements called pollers. For more information, visit www.bkk.hu/sugarutak.
 
This event is also a part of the Hungarian Cyclists' Club's "joyride" on Tuesday. 

So, what can you expect at the event? Arrive hungry and thirsty because we have a delicious spread waiting for you! Treat yourself to chocolate snails, cheesy pockets, apples, granola bars, water, and fruit juice. 

How should you get to the event? Well, by bike, of course! The location at K√°lvin t√©r is easily accessible via the protected bicycle lanes along √úll≈ëi √∫t or the inner ring road (kisk√∂r√∫t). Alternatively, you can also come from the Baross utca pedestrian and bicycle zone, either on your own bike or by using MOL Bubi, the city's bike-sharing system. If you choose to ride a MOL Bubi bike, you'll find bike stations at K√°lvin t√©r and next to the Museum Garden.

 ### Apokalipszis most / Apocalypse Now

Apocalypse Now, a colorful and subtitled American film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, will be screened at Bem Mozi in Budapest on Tuesday, August 15, 2023, from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM (UTC+02). Starring Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, and Harrison Ford, this 183-minute epic war movie is not recommended for viewers under 18 years old.

In Apocalypse Now, Captain Willard (played by Martin Sheen) is given a special mission by the Saigon CIA to assassinate the obviously insane Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). This task could easily cost him his life. Willard must make his way through hostile territory to the Cambodian border, where the "Green Beret" Colonel has been living in the mountains, commanding his private army of worshippers.

As Willard traverses the war-torn landscape, his journey becomes a nightmarish descent into madness and senseless violence, reflecting the deliberate or fear-induced carnage of the Vietnam War.

Compared to previous versions shown in cinemas and the 145-minute version requested by the studio after numerous scenes were cut, the current iteration, known as the "Final Cut," is 183 minutes long. Director Francis Ford Coppola, during the film's premiere at the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival in New York, stated that this version best reflects his vision.

Tickets for the screening can be purchased in three ways: 
1) On-site at Bem Mozi between 17:00 and 21:00 every day, 
2) Online at cooltix.hu/b/bemmozi, or 
3) By reservation via the jotform.com link provided. Reserved tickets must be collected at least 30 minutes before the screening. Please note that tickets do not guarantee reserved seating, as it will be on a first-come, first-served basis. The doors will open approximately 5 minutes before the start of the screening.
