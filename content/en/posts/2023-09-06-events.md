 ### MEGNYITÓ | Benyovszky-Szűcs Domonkos | Caelestia Crimina – Égi bűnök 

MEGNYITÓ | Benyovszky-Szűcs Domonkos | Caelestia Crimina - Heavenly Crimes

Join us for the opening of Benyovszky-Szűcs Domonkos' exhibition "Caelestia Crimina - Heavenly Crimes" at Faur Zsófi Galéria on Wednesday, September 6th at 7:00 PM UTC+02. The exhibition focuses on the aestheticized, invisible forms of violence and their propagation through the means of art.

The centerpiece of the exhibition revolves around elements saturated with violence that contribute not only to oppression but also to its systemic reproduction through their invisibility. Traditionally, these phenomena arrive to us "censored" through romantic or erotic depictions of violence. The sexualized and often aestheticized abuse is also a prominent product of the pornography industry, with similar themes abundantly found in Greek and Roman mythology. These stories were depicted by the baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens with a new sensuality, which is brought into dialogue with the visuality of "feature" pornographic films characteristic of the turn of the millennium. The title of the exhibition reflects this cultural context, borrowing from Ovid: Caelestia Crimina - Heavenly Crimes.

The exhibition does not seek to assign blame, fault, or stigmatize; rather, it aims to draw attention to a widely prevalent and silenced phenomenon through the tools of contemporary visual art. Alongside paintings and risographs, some works will be presented as domestic violence analogies in the form of household textiles (towels, cushion covers) that can be purchased and taken home.

As part of the exhibition, we will be collecting donations to support the Patent Association, which is engaged in legal advocacy, assistance, research, and awareness-raising activities in the field of violence against women.

Event details:
- Date: Wednesday, September 6th, 2023
- Time: 7:00 PM UTC+02
- Location: Faur Zsófi Galéria, 1114 Budapest, Bartók Béla út 25

The exhibition will be open for viewing at Faur Zsófi Galéria from September 6th to September 29th, on weekdays from 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM.

Join us for this thought-provoking exhibition by Benyovszky-Szűcs Domonkos, a talented artist who explores the dynamics of representation and how images shape our perceptions of the world. His art centers around the borderland between social and subjective reality, with a focus on the body. Through various painting languages, he examines the functioning of personality or, from a broader perspective, the social phenomenon of body image. He conceptually utilizes the medium of painting, sometimes embedding messages between layers of paint, and at other times obscuring the representation with plastic paint as a symbolic reference to the mental space created by the images beyond their physical boundaries.

Don't miss this opportunity to engage with powerful contemporary art and support a cause dedicated to combating violence against women. Join us for the opening of "Caelestia Crimina - Heavenly Crimes" at Faur Zsófi Galéria.

 ### Hommage à Duchamp | fotóalapú válogatás a Tóth Csaba Gyűjteményből

The B32 Gallery and Cultural Space in Budapest will be hosting an event titled "Hommage à Duchamp - fotóalapú válogatás a Tóth Csaba Gyűjteményből" which translates to "Hommage to Duchamp - a photo-based selection from the Tóth Csaba Collection". The exhibition will be on display from September 6th till October 13th, 2023, on weekdays between 10 am and 6 pm.

Marcel Duchamp, a renowned artist, famously exhibited an everyday object, a urinal, in 1917. Rather than creating a new artwork, Duchamp transformed it into a ready-made aesthetic object. This concept of the interaction between thought and execution has been followed in conceptual artworks ever since. In this exhibition, the focus is on the equal importance of process and visuals, with a significant emphasis on documentation and experimental use of photography.

Tóth Csaba, a curator working in commercial television, has been building his contemporary art collection for fifteen years, focusing on choices that disrupt and provoke viewers through visual tricks, wordplay, and the questioning of "reality" and the media industry.

The exhibition will feature works from various artists, including Bohus Réka, Czigány Ákos, Csörgő Attila, Dezső Tamás, Eperjesi Ágnes, Esterházy Marcell, Felsmann István, Ficzek Ferenc, Gerhes Gábor, Halász Károly, Jovánovics György, Kismányoky Károly, Kútvölgyi-Szabó Áron, Magyar Ádám, Perlaki Márton, Puklus Péter, Szabó Dezső, Szentjóby Tamás, Tót Endre, Tóth Gábor, Tranker Kata, Vető János, as well as Marcel Dzama, Stano Filko, and Eva Kot’atková.

The exhibition is supported by the National Cultural Fund, and entrance is open to the public. The opening event will take place on September 6th at 6:00 pm and will be inaugurated by Tóth Csaba, the collector, and Ébli Gábor, an aestheticist. The gallery's address is Bartók Béla út 32 in Budapest. For further information, you can contact the gallery via phone at +36 70 682 21 42 or +36 1 787 0045, or by email at b32@ujbuda.hu. Visit the website at b32kulturter.hu for more details and updates.

 ### Látencia: Kondor Attila - Szurcsik József - Várady Róbert kiállítása

Látencia: Kondor Attila - Szurcsik József - Várady Róbert Exhibition

Join us on Wednesday, September 6, 2023, at 6:00 PM UTC+02 for the opening of the Látencia exhibition featuring works by Kondor Attila, Szurcsik József, and Várady Róbert. The event will take place at the Újlipótvárosi Klub-Galéria in Budapest.

The exhibition explores transitional states and emotions, such as uncertainty, disorientation, emotional detachment, stillness, memory, concentration, meditation, and dystopian societies. Through their artwork, the three artists invite us to uncover and experience the latent, underlying causes and to find inner freedom in how we respond to different situations.

Psychologists often distinguish between periods of human development when self-regulation is weak (when children are unable to restrain their desires, wait, or control their emotions, without considering the consequences) and the latency period, when recognition and stepping out of an egocentric view occur, resulting in the release of energy. In Várady Róbert's paintings, the figures withdraw within themselves, turning inward, yet they still perceive and pick up on subtle signs from the world. Or perhaps, are they the ones causing the palpable ripples in the air? Similarly, Kondor Attila's creations continue the journey of self-discovery by offering strategies for exploration, whether through meditation, silence, or prayer. Rather than suppressing our consciousness, we direct our attention, seeking clarity and light. This pursuit requires practice, self-discipline, and patience. These spiritual processes can be accompanied by self-critical milestones.

Szurcsik József's paintings suggest an introspective state in which there is a tangible and burning fire right in front of our eyes, yet we cannot be certain whether it is a sign of human life in the midst of natural disasters or a manifestation of supernatural forces. Latency is a period of awakening, where rubbing our eyes is not enough to see; we must slowly move our hand away from our face to allow the light to reach us.

The exhibition will be open for viewing from September 6 to September 29, 2023, during the gallery's opening hours (Monday to Friday, 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM).

Don't miss the opportunity to immerse yourself in this thought-provoking exhibition by talented Hungarian artists.
