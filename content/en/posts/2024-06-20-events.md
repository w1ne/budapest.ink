Are you passionate about mathematics and eager to delve into the intriguing realm of optimal transport? If so, the ELTE Summer School in Mathematics 2024 at E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University in Budapest, Hungary, is the perfect opportunity for you! This one-week long summer school will focus on the theme of "Optimal transport: discrete and continuous", offering a deep dive into a fascinating mathematical subject.

The concept of optimal transport can be traced back to a paper by Gaspard Monge in 1781, revolving around the idea of moving mass from one location to another at the lowest cost. Dive into the discrete version of the problem, akin to finding a minimal weight matching in a valued bipartite graph. Explore the rich history of the field, including the significant contributions of mathematicians like Leonid Kantorovich and Hungarian scholars D√©nes K≈ënig and Jen≈ë Egerv√°ry.

This summer school is designed for advanced undergraduate, starting graduate, and interested PhD students, providing a solid introduction to this captivating field. The lectures, delivered by esteemed professors from ELTE, the Alfr√©d R√©nyi Institute of Mathematics, and the Hausdorff Institute in Bonn, will be held at the L√°gym√°nyos Campus of E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University.

Don't miss the opportunity to enhance your mathematical knowledge, engage with complex problem-solving, and interact with leading experts in the field. Join us for this intellectually stimulating and enriching experience at ELTE Summer School in Mathematics 2024!
