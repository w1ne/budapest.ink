The esteemed speaker, Valentina Acu√±a, a historian and doctoral candidate in sociology at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, will delve into her ethnographic research that intertwines political geology with the indigenous communities' perspectives on dwelling in the land of the Atacama Desert. Specifically, she will focus on the geothermal field "El Tatio," situated in the Atacama Desert, 4,290 meters above sea level.

By examining the practices and memories of the Atacame√±os towards this sacred site, Valentina Acu√±a will shed light on how indigenous peoples view the Earth as more than just a backdrop for social and political activities. From exploring affective customs to the embodied knowledge passed down through generations, the lecture will reveal the deep vitality that indigenous communities derive from their connection with the Earth. Moreover, it will touch upon moments of tension and conflicting practices, including exploitative relationships with the environment.

The lecture will commence with an introduction by B√©la Solt√©sz from the Department of Global and Development Studies at E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University. The event will be conducted in English, without translation, and is free for all members of the public. No prior registration is required.
