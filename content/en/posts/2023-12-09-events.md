 ### FRAT pres.: AWEMINUS (USA) / NOSPHERE (HU) @Playground

FRAT presents: AWEMINUS (USA) / NOSPHERE (HU) @Playground

Are you ready for our last headline event of the year? For our final event with foreign headliners, we decided to end the season properly. And who better to achieve that than the legendary AWEMINUS?

AWEMINUS needs no introduction. He is one of the greatest dubstep legends that has ever existed in the scene, and he is still releasing bangers after bangers to this day. After touring festivals and performing at huge shows in the US, he is finally coming to the bass capital, Budapest, on December 9th.

But that's not all! We also have NOSPHERE on the lineup, who is the biggest bass artist from our own country. He is well-known for his music all around the world, and it's an absolute pleasure for us that he wanted to experience the FRAT vibes as an artist. We can't wait to hear what he has cooked up for our event.

As usual, our crew will be fully prepared to make everyone's rave perfect with the hardest doubles and triples they could find. So mark your calendars for December 9th because it's the last time this year that you can experience the incredible energy of FRAT (don't worry, PreNewYear is still happening haha).

 ### ROLLING TECHNIQUE ON ROPE AND SILKS

**ROLLING TECHNIQUE ON ROPE AND SILKS**

Are you interested in improving your rolling technique on rope and silks? Look no further, because a special workshop is taking place that's just what you need! On Saturday, December 9, 2023, from 5:00 AM to 8:00 AM UTC+01, join us for a 3-hour intensive led by Gaia Santuccio. This workshop is organized by INspirál Cirkuszközpont and will help you understand and enhance the art of rolling on both rope and silks.

During this intensive workshop, Gaia will share a variety of exercises and sequences that will enable you to develop and refine your rolling technique. Starting with roll ups, roll downs, and rolling on the spot, you will progress to more dynamic entries into S-lock. Gaia has extensively researched and honed these techniques, and she will guide you through slow, controlled, and dynamic entries, starting from the ground and progressively moving into the air.

The aim of this workshop is to offer participants the opportunity to refresh and deepen their understanding of the basics while experiencing them through Gaia's unique perspective. Additionally, Gaia will provide personal technical advice and address any specific questions or ideas participants may have.

Gaia Santuccio is an accomplished artist originally from Sicily. After completing her Master studies in Contemporary Circus Practices at DOCH, she was part of the pilot year at ICCAR (International Circus Centre for Artistic Research) under the guidance of Roberto Magro. She has also studied Etienne Decroux's mime technique at Moveo in Barcelona and graduated from Circomedia in Bristol and the National Centre for Circus Arts in London.

Gaia's creative research focuses on movement through knots and sensing, and her workshops are designed to encourage participants to develop their own styles, words, and language through movement. She aims to create a more conscious and in-depth practice by fostering personal and intimate experiences with the rope. In addition to her work in the circus, Gaia's artistic endeavors also include writing, movement, photography, videography, and crochet.

This workshop is open to participants of all levels, although prior experience in climbing on the rope is essential in order to fully engage with the workshop's content. However, if some exercises prove to be too challenging, you can always learn through observing and taking notes to try again later.

The price for this workshop is 9,000 HUF. To apply, please email gaiasantuccio90@gmail.com.

Don't miss this opportunity to improve your rolling technique on rope and silks with Gaia Santuccio. Mark your calendars for Saturday, December 9, 2023, and join us at the workshop organized by INspirál Cirkuszközpont. We look forward to seeing you there!
