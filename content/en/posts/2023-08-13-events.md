 ### Don Quijote - Tánc a Kertben

Event Announcement: Don Quijote - Tánc a Kertben

Join us for a captivating evening of dance at the Várkert Bazár in Budapest on Sunday, August 13, 2023, at 8:30 PM UTC+02. Organized by Várkert Bazár, this event promises to be a unique experience showcasing the contemporary adaptation of Don Quijote.

In this performance, the modern man is depicted as someone who dreams of a different world and life. Wearing clothes and masks to cope with the challenges of everyday life, he strives to make the world around him better by condemning its decline. However, he is often deemed as crazy and marginalized by society. The contemporary Don Quijote is a misled, disappointed, and ironic dreamer, who transforms into a tragic character.

Sancho Panza, the foundation of the wandering knight's story, symbolizes the courage to fight against disappointment faced with reality. Nowadays, people navigate through a cruel vision of the future where there seems to be no place for imagination, fantasy, and expectations. It becomes a struggle to realize an existing project that one can identify with. Life constantly imposes unusual compromises, defeats, and sorrows on individuals. Yet, with a hint of idealism, every madman can be wiser than one can imagine and discover their true essence, their existence.

The performance will feature Deák Kristóf, Horváth Bence, and Engelmann András, with music provided by montázs and lighting designed by Hepkó Miklós. The visual and costume design will be crafted by Feledi János, who is also responsible for the direction and choreography. The presentation of the show is a collaborative program held at the Nemzeti Táncszínház.

This event is made possible with the support of the Emberi Erőforrás Támogatáskezelő, Nemzeti Táncszínház, and Magyar Művészeti Akadémia, and is produced in partnership with Pro Progressione and the Budapest Táncfesztivál. Special thanks go to Bendik Márta.

In case of rain, the event's rain date is set for August 15, 2023.

Don't miss this remarkable dance performance that explores the complexities of human existence and invites you to ponder the power of imagination against the realities of life. Purchase your tickets now at [https://bit.ly/DonQuijote_TáncAKertben](https://bit.ly/DonQuijote_TáncAKertben) and immerse yourself in an enchanting evening of dance at the Várkert Bazár.

 ### Miniszobrok budai sétája

Join us for a unique walking tour in Budapest, known as Miniszobrok budai sétája, organized by Korzózz Velünk. This event will take place on Sunday, August 13, 2023, from 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM UTC+02.

During this tour, we will embark on a quest to discover the secrets of the mini sculptures scattered throughout Budapest. Have you ever wondered how many mini statues can fit into one walk? It could be more than forty! But where exactly can we find these hidden gems in the city? Let's delve into the adventurous mysteries of these urban sculptures and uncover their fascinating stories as we explore the unknown side of Budapest.

What could be the function of a mini statue? Can we decipher the secret behind their chosen locations? Do other cities around the world have similar counterparts to the sculptures along the banks of the Danube? Who was the first mysterious guerrilla sculptor to secretly place statues in Budapest, before Kolodko Mihály? And can a mini sculpture convey as much meaning as its larger counterparts?

We will dive into the world of the smallest and largest sculptures, discover peculiar records among statues and reliefs, and explore the role that these growing number of small artworks play among Budapest's other sculptures, memorials, and genre sculptures. After all, it's not about finding a place for the statue, but about the statue finding its place within the city.

For more detailed information about the event, you can visit the official website [here](https://www.korzozzvelunk.hu/miniszobrok-budai-setaja/). If you would like to participate in the program, please sign up [here](https://www.korzozzvelunk.hu/setanaptar/).

This concert is inspired by the captivating nature of smoke. It can rise from a burning cigarette or the crackling of autumn leaves on a damp afternoon.

It can evoke a range of emotions - intoxication, passion, sensuality, and intimate tranquility. Just like music...

Famous and atmospheric songs accompanied by ethereal piano, original and humorous interludes, and a smoky voice that guides the audience from one chord to another. Throughout the evening, you'll hear well-known songs that will instantly be recognized by the audience, creating a captivating and magical shared experience of singing along. The performances will also pay tribute to the memories of Ella Fitzgerald, Gershwin, Edith Piaf, Nat King Cole, G. Dénes György, and Cserháti Zsuzsa.

The piano accompaniment will be provided by Grósz Zsuzsanna.
