### Research Seminar: Policymaker Risk Preferences in a Portfolio Model of Industrial Sectors

**Date and Time:** Wednesday, March 27, 2024, 12:15 PM – 1:30 PM CET

Are you fascinated by the intricate dance between policymaker risk preferences and industrial sector portfolios? Well, mark your calendars for the upcoming Finance Department Research Seminar happening on Wednesday, March 27, from 12:15 to 13:30. The seminar will be held in room QA102, where András Bethlendi from the BME Department of Finance will delve into the captivating world of policymaker risk preferences in a portfolio model of industrial sectors. Together with Christopher Stapenhurst from the BME QSMS Research Group, they will present their insightful joint work, titled "Policymaker risk preferences in a portfolio model of industrial sectors."

In this seminar, they will explore how integrating social attitudes towards risk and innovative policy simulations can guide the selection of optimal policies among efficient ones. By scrutinizing Hungary as a case study, they uncover fascinating insights. For instance, they reveal that expanding sectors like Information and communication, Scientific and technical activities, Administrative and support services, and Mining might be optimal for certain levels of risk aversion. Conversely, expanding other sectors, even those that enhance stability, may not be deemed optimal under various parameters. 

Research seminars like these provide a unique opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamic interplay between policymaker risk preferences and industrial sector portfolios. So, don't miss out on this enriching seminar that promises to unravel intriguing perspectives in the realm of finance. Join us on March 27 to expand your horizons and delve into the complexities of policymaker choices in the world of industrial sectors.

Come, be a part of this insightful journey as we navigate through the complexities of policymaker risk preferences in a diverse portfolio model of industrial sectors. Let's explore together and uncover the hidden gems that lie beneath the surface of economic growth and stability.
