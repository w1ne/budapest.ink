 ### THYLACINE, support: OIEE // A38 Hajó

Get ready for an electrifying night of music as THYLACINE, supported by OIEE, takes the stage at A38 Hajó on Saturday, October 7, 2023, at 11:55 PM UTC+02.

THYLACINE, the scientific name for the Tasmanian wolf, is a species that became extinct 70 years ago. This precious word has been chosen by William Rezé to embody his progressive electronica. With a thirst for freedom ingrained in his DNA, THYLACINE is always searching for new musical horizons. Each track is unique, influenced by a wide range of artists, from pioneers like Steve Reich and Philip Glass to John Zorn's jazz experimentation and Massive Attack's trip-hop. THYLACINE's music merges the rhythmic and melancholic techno of Paul Kalkbrenner with the ethereal melodies of Moderat and Four Tet. But THYLACINE's musical pursuits go beyond traditional boundaries, pushing limits and exploring new sonic landscapes.

The stage is another realm that THYLACINE loves to explore. During his live performances, he wants to feel as free as he does in the studio. A fearless and improvisational performer, he incorporates his alto saxophone into the mix, breaking free from the constraints of machines. With captivating visuals and immersive scenography, THYLACINE blurs the lines between the dancefloor and fantasy, taking us on a wild and intimate journey with a mysterious destination.

Supporting THYLACINE for the night is OIEE, a musician who blends electronic music with tropical house, nudisco, disco, trance, and R&B influences, creating melodic tunes that make you want to dance. OIEE's second album was released in April and features collaborations with Grammy-winning producer Steve Dub (The Chemical Brothers, The Prodigy), SENA, Aluphobia, WaTa, Badfocus (CZ), and Zahár Fanni. With a monthly listenership of 20-25,000 on Spotify, OIEE's music has gained popularity. Several of his songs, including "Still Dey Inside" and "Marathon," have premiered on BBC 1Xtra, and his music videos for "Stays Like This" and "Kawhi" (featuring Amaarae and M3nsa) have won awards at the Hungarian Klipszemle.

OIEE has previously performed in Prague, Brno, Nitra, Groningen, at the Mumush Festival in Transylvania, and regularly in Transylvania. This year, he performed at the United Islands of Prague festival, as well as other festivals in Transylvania, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. In September, he embarked on a week-long tour in Romania. OIEE has also been invited to perform at Eurosonic, Europe's largest showcase festival, in January 2023.

Don't miss this opportunity to witness the incredible talents of THYLACINE, supported by OIEE, at A38 Hajó on October 7th. Get your tickets now at https://bit.ly/thylacine_1007 and get ready for a night of unforgettable music and boundless creativity.
