 ### THYLACINE, support: OIEE // A38 Hajó

Join us on Saturday, October 7, 2023, at 11:55 PM UTC+02 for an electrifying night of music with THYLACINE and support act OIEE at A38 Hajó in Budapest.

THYLACINE, named after the extinct Tasmanian wolf, is the brainchild of William Rezé. With his progressive electronic sound, THYLACINE embodies the spirit of freedom and constantly seeks new musical horizons. Each track is a unique blend of influences, ranging from the repetitive pioneers like Steve Reich and Philip Glass to the jazz experimentations of John Zorn and the trip-hop vibes of Massive Attack. Combining the cadenced and melancholic techno of Paul Kalkbrenner with the ethereal melodies of Moderat or Four Tet, THYLACINE's music pushes the boundaries of what is possible.

But THYLACINE doesn't just confine himself to the studio. He uses the stage as another creative space. During his live performances, THYLACINE aims to feel as free as possible, unleashing his alto saxophone and immersing himself in the music. His fearless and improvisational style breaks free from the constraints of machines, creating a unique and captivating experience. With captivating visual projections and an immersive scenography, his live acts blur the lines between dancefloor and fantasy, taking us on a mesmerizing journey with an unknown destination.

Joining THYLACINE is OIEE, an artist known for his ability to merge electronic music with tropical house, nudisco, disco, trance, and R&B. OIEE recently released his second album, featuring collaborations with Grammy Award-winning Steve Dub, SENA, Aluphobia, WaTa, Badfocus (CZ), and Zahár Fanni. With monthly listens on Spotify reaching 20-25,000, OIEE's music is gaining recognition. His tracks "Still Dey Inside" and "Marathon" premiered on BBC 1Xtra, and his music videos for "Stays Like This" and "Kawhi" (featuring Amaarae and M3nsa) won awards at the Hungarian Klipszemle.

Don't miss out on this incredible night of music at A38 Hajó. Get your tickets now and embark on a wild and intimate journey with THYLACINE and OIEE. The doors open at 11:55 PM UTC+02, so get ready to dance the night away.
