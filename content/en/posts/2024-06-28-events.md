### Organizer
- **Organizer:** K√∂z√©p-Eur√≥pai M≈±v√©szett√∂rt√©neti Kutat√≥int√©zet - KEMKI

Have you ever wondered about the secret world of the art market and the intricate web of infrastructures that facilitate the trading and transferring of artworks? Well, wonder no more because the K√∂z√©p-Eur√≥pai M≈±v√©szett√∂rt√©neti Kutat√≥int√©zet (KEMKI) is here to shed light on this fascinating topic! On June 27th and 28th, in collaboration with the University of Amsterdam and Leuphana University in Germany, KEMKI is hosting a workshop that delves deep into the mechanisms that drive the art market.

Featuring over 20 speakers from around the globe, this workshop is set to uncover the hidden institutions and networks that underlie the art world's commercial and non-commercial transactions. Keynote lectures by Ana Magalh√£es from S√£o Paulo and Nathalie Heinich from Paris promise to offer unique insights into this complex ecosystem. Among the speakers are researchers from KEMKI, adding a local touch to the international lineup.

Art market studies have gained momentum in recent years, but there's still much to explore when it comes to understanding the actors, places, rules, and structures that shape this domain. Led by Gregor Langfeld, Krist√≥f Nagy, and Lynn Rother, this workshop aims to dissect the infrastructures that have influenced the creation and exchange of artworks since 1900. The presentations will touch on various themes, including transnational perspectives, canon formation, dynamics of innovation, and the impact of gender and diversity.

The workshop will be divided into five panels spread over two days, each focusing on different aspects of art trading and transferring. From discussions on selling during war and conflict to exploring how art navigates borders, the panels promise a deep dive into the multifaceted world of art markets. The event will culminate in a closing discussion that aims to tie together all the threads explored during the workshop.

So if you're intrigued by the intricate dance of art, money, and reputation that shapes the art market, mark your calendars for June 27th and 28th. Join us as we unravel the mysteries of the infrastructures of trading and transferring art since 1900!

*Please note that the event timings are in Central European Summer Time.*
